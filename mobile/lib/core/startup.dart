/// Extracted from `main()` so it can be tested. A store that is never loaded still passes every one
/// of its own tests — it round-trips through disk perfectly — and silently forgets the user's
/// choice at the next launch. Nothing else in the suite would notice, because the only thing wrong
/// is a missing call in the entrypoint. This is that call, in a place a test can reach.
///
/// They are awaited before `runApp` rather than loaded lazily: reading them after the first frame
/// would paint the defaults and then snap to the saved values, which reads as a flicker on every
/// launch.

/// The parameters exist for tests; the app passes nothing and gets the singletons the widgets read.
