/// TWO sizes exist in this app, deliberately, and the distinction is worth
/// stating because two sizes is otherwise exactly the drift this file was
/// written to end:
///
///   [compact] — a CONTEXT menu. A short list of actions on the thing you just
///   right-clicked or pressed ⋯ on: the machine and agent menus, the account
///   menu. macOS sets these tight, and they are read in a glance.
///
///   [roomy] — a PICKER's list. The menu IS the control: it is the only place
///   the choices are ever shown, it is read down rather than glanced at, and it
///   is often long enough to scroll. macOS gives a popup button's list more room
///   than a context menu for the same reason.
///
/// A third size would be drift. Reach for one of these two.
