# Harness Desktop

Harness Desktop is the native Flutter client for browsing Harness machines and
interacting with their terminal-backed agents. macOS and Linux (Ubuntu) are released upstream targets. This fork adds a **Windows 11 x64 prototype**, with a native desktop interface and a WSL2 CLI backend.

## Development

Install a compatible Flutter SDK, then run the project from `desktop/`:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
flutter run -d macos   # or: flutter run -d linux, or: flutter run -d windows
```

Useful validation commands:

```bash
dart analyze
flutter build macos --debug
flutter build macos --release
flutter build linux --release     # must run on an Ubuntu host — no cross-compiling
flutter build windows --release   # must run on a Windows 11 x64 host
```

## Windows prototype

The desktop interface runs natively on Windows 11 x64. The supported integration target runs the Harness CLI, managed Node runtime, and tmux terminals in a named WSL2 development distribution. The desktop connects to the daemon over loopback; that connection still requires validation on the installed WSL networking configuration.

Windows setup requires a WSL2 distribution with the CLI and tmux. A native Windows launcher answering `version` does not satisfy that requirement: the CLI's terminal backend requires tmux. Docker Desktop's `docker-desktop` and `docker-desktop-data` distributions are excluded from selection, probes, and installation. WSL commands always name their distribution and pass user arguments as separate arguments.

When prerequisites are missing, setup shows the relevant commands. Recheck inspects readiness; installation uses the explicit automatic setup action or the displayed manual command. Installing a development distribution and creating its Linux user remains an attended Windows setup step. For Ubuntu, the Windows PowerShell command is:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Complete any Windows restart and Ubuntu user creation requested by that installer. Recheck in Harness, then follow the setup command shown for that distribution. Windows folders sent to WSL are converted to the conventional `/mnt/<drive>/...` path; installations using custom drive mounts should select an existing folder with the backend browser. WSL UNC paths require the matching identified distribution. Network shares and ambiguous relative paths are refused.

### Build an unsigned Windows bundle

Use Flutter 3.47 or newer, the Visual Studio Desktop development with C++ workload, and the Windows SDK. From `desktop/`, in Git Bash:

```bash
bash scripts/build-windows-release.sh
```

The script runs dependency resolution, analysis, tests, and a Windows release build. It packages the entire `Release/` directory, app-local MSVC runtime files, and license notices under `dist/`, then checks the portable SHA-256 file and archive contents. Keep the executable, DLLs, and `data/` directory together when extracting it.

For investigating a known failing baseline, `ALLOW_TEST_FAILURES=1` permits packaging after test failures and returns a nonzero result. Such a bundle is a prototype, not a passed test run. Analysis and native import-inspection failures remain visible. The script does not sign, upload, or publish the bundle.

### Current limits

The migration's checks and remaining work are recorded in [WINDOWS_PORT.md](WINDOWS_PORT.md). A release build alone does not establish a completed WSL setup, signed-in agent session, terminal reconnect, or compatibility on macOS and Linux. Windows self-update is not implemented. Most application shortcuts still use the Meta/Windows key, which conflicts with some Windows system shortcuts; Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab remain available for switching panes.

The terminal core is vendored at `third_party/xterm`. Do not replace it with an
upstream package upgrade without preserving the local rendering and IME fixes.

## Open media from agent output

Hold **⌘ and click** on macOS, or **Ctrl and click** on Linux, to open an
image/video path in the OS default app. HTTP(S) links open in the default browser.
Hover over a recognized path to see the shortcut and full target. Normal clicks,
text selection, copy/paste and terminal mouse input keep their existing behavior.

Local previews support absolute paths, `~/...` and `file://...` URLs, including
spaces, Unicode, visible Markdown links and terminal soft wraps. The file must
already exist. Relative paths need a full path because CLI agent frames do not
currently include the working directory.

For a remote agent, the same shortcut downloads the file over the existing E2EE
connection and opens the completed local copy in the OS viewer. The remote
machine must run a CLI advertising `mediaPreview`; older CLIs show update guidance.
Remote relative paths resolve inside that agent's working folder; absolute paths,
`~/...`, and `file://...` resolve on the remote machine, including artifacts in `/tmp`.
The pane shows download progress and Cancel. Closing/changing panes cancels the
download. An interrupted transfer or a file changed during transfer is never opened.

Previews are limited to 512 MiB per file and downloaded in bounded chunks. Copies
live in `~/.harness/desktop-app/media-previews`; before each download, inactive
copies older than 24 hours or over the 1 GiB cache budget are pruned. Cache names
are unique, so matching paths on different machines cannot overwrite one another.
This reads visible terminal text, not hidden OSC 8 hyperlink targets.

The optional A/B smoke test uses isolated identities, two loopback WebSockets,
the CLI's real E2EE handshake/media reader and ffmpeg-generated PNG/MP4 fixtures:

```bash
REMOTE_MEDIA_CLI_ROOT=../autonomous-harness/cli flutter test test/remote_media_smoke_test.dart
```

Install the companion CLI's npm dependencies first; ffmpeg must be on PATH.
The smoke test does not use a real account or remote machine. It verifies the OS
launch URI; playback in the native viewer is a separate manual check.

## Local Codex profiles

New Agent → Codex discovers local profiles when the Harness CLI advertises
`supportsCodexHome`. The picker appears only when there are at least two distinct
profile folders; **Default** does not count as another profile. A single profile
is selected automatically, while no profiles keeps the normal launch. Linking
and refreshing remain available in both cases.

Discovery combines `CODEX_HOME` from the app environment, homes
observed on this computer's Codex agents, Codex-named folders in home/XDG config
with an existing `auth.json` or `config.toml` (including `.codex2` and
`.codex_work`), and directories explicitly linked before. An empty default
directory does not create a second profile.
It also reads literal `CODEX_HOME` declarations in bash/zsh/fish startup files,
aliases, functions, sourced files, and executable shell wrappers in local bin/PATH
directories. Shortcut names do not have to contain "codex". `$HOME`, `${HOME}`,
tilde and simple directory variables are supported; symlinks are deduplicated.

Discovery never executes shell configuration or shortcuts and never reads Codex
credentials. Shell scanning stops after 3 seconds, 256 small scripts, or four
levels of script references. Computed paths, unsupported shell syntax and profiles outside
these sources can be added with **Link a profile folder…**. Choose the actual
`CODEX_HOME` directory, not the shortcut executable or a named configuration
preset. Only linked paths are saved. **Refresh profiles** rescans without changing
the current choice; new local agent homes also update an open picker.

The selected directory supplies that agent’s Codex login, configuration, hooks,
history and model cache, and stays attached across restarts. The terminal header
shows its folder name and exposes the full path in a tooltip. **Default** keeps
the machine’s normal launch behavior. This picker applies to local agents using
Codex’s own account; remote machines use their existing flow.
The rail’s Codex usage panel still reports the default `~/.codex` profile.

This requires the companion CLI support for `agent_create.codexHome`. Older CLIs
show update guidance and keep default launches available; Desktop refuses an
explicit profile when support is missing rather than silently using another login.

## Local and production terminal E2E

The terminal E2E scripts exercise this desktop client together with source
checkouts of the Harness backend and CLI. The CLI is this repo's own `cli/`;
the backend is a sibling `autonomous-code` checkout. Their default layout is:

```text
.../autonomous-ai/
  autonomous-code/
  autonomous-harness/
    cli/
    backend/
    desktop/        <- this app
```

Set `AUTONOMOUS_CODE_ROOT` when the backend checkout is elsewhere and
`HARNESS_REPO_ROOT` when the Harness CLI checkout is elsewhere (it defaults to
this repo's root, i.e. `desktop/..`).

```bash
bash scripts/start-terminal-local-manual.sh
bash scripts/test-terminal-local-e2e.sh
PROD_TERMINAL_E2E=1 ... bash scripts/test-terminal-prod-e2e.sh
```

The production script deliberately requires release, deployment, machine, and
commit evidence before it sends terminal traffic to production.

## Autonomous device pairing

Settings → Devices discovers Autonomous devices on the same network using the
CLI's `_autonomous._tcp` discovery, reusing the device's existing advertisement. Start pairing on the Autonomous
device to generate its code, select that device in Desktop, and enter the code.
The Mac connects directly to the selected device without backend routing or a
manually entered IP address. The device needs no backend credentials; Harness’s
existing Mac login/start requirements remain unchanged.

The pairing form is one shared settings row: device picker with an adjacent refresh
icon, code field and Pair button. The form aligns with the title at the top; a
visible note explains that closing Desktop leaves the connection running.

Desktop uses `harness autonomous-device discover --json` to populate the picker.
The CLI resolves the selected discovery ID to its host and port. Pairing runs
`harness autonomous-device pair --code-stdin --device <discoveryId> --json` through
`HarnessCliRunner`; the code travels through stdin only, never argv or logs.
Code normalization matches the original Harness pairing implementation, including
Crockford aliases and separators. The original PAKE handshake authenticates the
connection. Changing or losing the selected discovery identity clears entered
code, and a code mismatch remains visible through background refreshes. A mismatch
consumes the device pairing window: generate a new code before retrying. Rate
limits require waiting five minutes before another attempt. Desktop allows the
pair command fifty seconds to finish, beyond the CLI’s bounded handshake deadline.

`status` and `list` report direct connections and saved device identities.
Revocation requires confirmation and targets the complete saved fingerprint.
Closing Desktop leaves the CLI daemon running. Discovery and status refresh every sixty seconds, including when no device is
paired. Use Refresh to discover a newly started device immediately. Pasted codes
may include separators, for example `ABC-123`. Older CLIs show `harness update`
guidance. Widget tests inject a fake CLI, and the `kUnderTest` gate prevents real
processes and background polling.

## Releases

The application self-updates from the Harness desktop metadata manifest in the
public GCS release bucket. Release commands stay in this repository:

```bash
make upload-desktop           # macOS
make upload-desktop-linux     # Linux (ARM64 or x64) — must run on the matching Ubuntu build host
make upload-desktop-linux ARCH=arm64
make upload-desktop-linux ARCH=amd64  # amd64 is the x64 artifact
make upload-node-runtime ARGS="22.23.2"
```

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for signing, notarization, versioning, managed
Node runtime publishing, safe test releases, and rollback behavior.

Pairing failures use the original Harness manager's validation and attempt limits.
If the device code expires, start pairing again on the Autonomous device.

## App focus and device voice routing

The selected terminal pane is the source of agent focus for the CLI's paired-device
voice mode and the OS Monitor Pairing page. Desktop announces `app_focus` with its
`agentId` through the existing local CLI WebSocket, and reasserts the selected pane
after reconnect. Opening an unrelated terminal or changing which macOS/Linux
window is frontmost does not select another voice agent. Closing the selected pane
announces the replacement pane; closing the last pane or selecting a machine-only
pane sends `app_focus` with `agentId: null`. Switching machines clears the previous
connection's focus before announcing the new target. This requires the CLI version
that publishes app focus to paired devices; there is no separate voice-agent picker
in Desktop.

### Đồng bộ agent đang focus và giọng nói từ device

Pane terminal đang được chọn là nguồn focus cho voice mode của device đã pair và
trang Monitor Pairing của OS. Desktop gửi `app_focus` kèm `agentId` qua WebSocket
local CLI hiện có, và gửi lại pane đang chọn sau khi kết nối lại. Mở terminal khác
ở nền hoặc đổi cửa sổ macOS/Linux ở phía trước không chọn lại voice agent. Đóng
pane đang chọn sẽ thông báo pane thay thế; đóng pane cuối hoặc chọn pane chỉ có
machine sẽ gửi `app_focus` với `agentId: null`. Khi đổi machine, Desktop xóa focus
trên kết nối trước rồi thông báo target mới. Cần phiên bản CLI có hỗ trợ chia sẻ
app focus cho device đã pair; Desktop không có bộ chọn voice agent riêng.
