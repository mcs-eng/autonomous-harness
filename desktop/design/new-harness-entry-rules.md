# New Harness entry rules

Startup and Cmd-T show the same quiet welcome page. Cmd-T creates a blank tab;
Escape leaves that tab open. The command dock opens only after an explicit
Cmd-N, Cmd-O, or Cmd-P action. Start Harness submits the reviewed draft;
opening or cancelling the dock never starts a harness.

The launch form starts with Agent, Machine, and Project, followed by Start
Harness, which is selected initially. There is no heading, Task row, or Open In
row. Cmd-O and Cmd-P pickers also omit their heading and result-count row.
Tasks carried from search or Store examples remain part of the draft.

| Entry | Initial values | Destination after a successful start |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cmd-T, then Cmd-N | Previous pane's agent, machine, and project | The blank tab opened by Cmd-T |
| Cmd-O or Cmd-P → New Harness | Focused pane's agent, machine, and project | Current tab |
| Cmd-N or the New Harness command | Focused pane's defaults; retain a task and destination already chosen in search | Current tab unless its source requests a new tab |
| Explicit pane split | Focused pane's defaults | Requested split in that tab |
| Store New Harness, or a product's Open action in the pane or native Models menu | Explicit product and machine; suggested project named for that product | New tab |
| Store Resume Harness | Existing harness and its machine; choose from a menu when several match | Focus its existing tab or reopen a view of the same harness |
| Store Try this prompt | Same as Open, with the example as the editable task | New tab |
| First empty workspace | No automatic action; show the welcome page | User chooses with Cmd-N, Cmd-O, or Cmd-S |

The Store and orchestration tabs cannot host a terminal pane. Generic creation
from either uses a new tab. Command-bar requests keep the workspace context and
apply any agent or machine explicitly named by the request.

Cmd-O and Cmd-P open the same picker. Repeating either shortcut preserves the
query, selection, highlighted result, and filters, then refocuses the input.
Cmd-T closes the dock and opens a quiet blank tab. Creation remains blocked
while a pending start needs confirmation.

## Git projects

Git projects show Branch, then Worktree. Worktree defaults to `[x]` for a
repository with a commit; Enter, Space, or a click toggles `[x]` and `[ ]`.
Folders without Git show neither row. Discovery runs on the selected machine
without fetching, switching branches, or creating a worktree. A failed
discovery offers Retry and blocks starting until the result is known.

A worktree is a temporary folder, never a project: a harness is known by the
folder it was started in and its repository's branch. Pane headers read
`folder › branch`, with the machine first only for another computer: the folder
the harness started in (a subfolder as itself, a checkout's root — a
worktree's too — as its repository), which does not follow the agent's shell,
and the branch with the same icon everywhere. A checkout on no branch — a
commit an agent checked out to read or test — shows no branch; the tooltip says
`No branch: on commit 65281563`. Worktree folders are never shown; the header's
tooltip has the full path. Cut short, the folder shortens in the
middle before the branch does. A folder inside a linked
worktree (the focused pane's, or one typed or browsed) shows as the same folder
in the repository's main checkout, so Cmd-N from a worktree pane starts beside
it rather than inside it. Worktrees Start made are never offered as recent
projects.

**Branch** starts on the default branch with Worktree on, and on the folder's
own branch with it off. It does not follow the pane New Harness was opened from:
New Harness is new work, and another agent's branch is one pick away. The Start
button reads **Start Harness** on every New Harness, whatever the rows say.
The picker names local branches; a remote branch is listed only when no local
branch has its name.

With `[x]`, **Branch** is what the new worktree works from. At Start a new
branch starts from the newer of that branch and its upstream, fetched for at
most ten seconds: `main` behind `origin/main` starts from `origin/main`, and
`main` with commits of its own starts from `main`, so nothing is lost; offline,
it starts from the last fetch. The branch the harness works on follows from it, with no row of its
own: the default or current branch gets a new branch named after the session
(`onboarding-experience`);
another local branch is checked out as it is; a remote branch nobody has
locally becomes a local branch of the same name tracking it; a branch that
already has a worktree opens there, as the Branch row's tooltip says. The
project folder's own branch cannot be checked out twice. Typing a name no
branch has offers **Create branch**: a new branch in a new worktree, from the
default branch. Spaces become `-` and anything Git refuses in a name is
dropped.

A session has no name at Start, so that branch starts as a made-up
`<word>-<word>`, marked `branch.<name>.harness = placeholder` in the
repository's config and left out of the pane header. The daemon renames it once,
to the session's name (`-2` when a local or remote branch has it), when the
session first has a name, and never again:
not after a later session name, a push, or a rename by the person or the agent.
A picked or created branch keeps its name. The worktree is checked out in
`~/harnesses/worktrees/<repository>/<branch>`, and ignored files listed in the
repository's `.worktreeinclude` (gitignore syntax, e.g. `.env`) are copied in.

With `[ ]`, **Branch** is the branch the folder itself is on; only local
branches are selectable. A branch with a worktree of its own opens there.
Typing a name no branch has offers **Create branch**:
a new branch from the folder's branch, keeping its uncommitted changes.
Switching or creating needs no harness working in the folder, and switching
also needs nothing uncommitted. No changes are forced,
stashed, or discarded. A selected subfolder follows into a new worktree only if
it exists in that commit.

The picker tags branches `default`, `current`, `worktree` and `remote`, and
leaves out branches Harness made (marked `branch.<name>.harness`, or named
`harness/…` by older builds) whose worktree is gone. The daemon removes a
worktree it finds in `~/harnesses/worktrees` only when no live or stopped
harness uses it, nothing is uncommitted, and it has been idle for a week; the
branch stays unless Harness made it and its commits are all elsewhere.

Drafts and advanced options preserve these choices. A lost start reply reuses
its receipt, and retrying a confirmed launch failure reuses its prepared
worktree: the retry selects that worktree's branch with Worktree off.

## Draft ownership

- Workspace drafts belong to their original machine, focused source harness,
  and project context. A different focused harness does not inherit their edits.
- Cmd-O and Cmd-P can resume the same workspace draft. The current tab controls
  placement; a saved draft cannot redirect it to an old destination.
- Store drafts belong to the explicitly requested product and machine. Opening
  Blender cannot restore Workshop's agent, task, or generated project name.
- Escape preserves edits. Reopening the same source without a new task resumes
  its compatible draft. Store Open still wins if the agent or machine was
  changed inside that saved draft.
- A newly typed search task or Store example starts from that entry's defaults.
  Repeating the same request while its draft is already open keeps its edits.
- A request awaiting confirmation is an exception: restore its exact values and
  receipt. A new task must not silently turn an uncertain start into a duplicate.
  An in-flight or uncertain draft cannot be replaced while it is open.
- Closing the dock does not discard unresolved receipts. Advanced options and
  return-to-dock preserve the same draft ownership and placement.

## Project names

Suggested projects display the existing `<agent>-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM` naming
convention. Untouched suggestions follow agent changes; a user's edited name
does not. The suggestion is frozen while reviewed. Project → New Project
prefills and selects the name so it can be replaced.

Each machine retains its own project choice. A folder on one machine is never
silently reused on another. Generated folders use exclusive reservation and
advance to seconds/a suffix only on a confirmed collision. Explicit names are
never silently renamed, and existing files are never overwritten.

## Regression coverage

- `test/new_harness_git_test.dart`, `test/git_worktree_test.dart`, and
  `test/git_worktree_failures_test.dart`: Git defaults, hidden non-Git rows,
  keyboard/click toggles, branch search, branch resolution, stale
  replies, retries, actual Git worktrees and branch safety, fetching,
  tracking, `.worktreeinclude`, process deadlines, and bounded output.
  `cli/src/lib/gitProject.spec.ts` and `worktreeSweep.spec.ts` cover the same
  rules on a remote machine and the daemon's cleanup.
- `test/new_harness_entry_rules_test.dart`: product changes with an open or
  dismissed dock, Open/Try, edited names, machine changes, explicit agent
  precedence, search isolation, exact launch payloads, pending receipts, source
  pane changes, and Cmd-O/Cmd-P draft recovery and placement. Repeated/switched
  shortcuts retain typed tasks, text selection, existing results, and project
  scope; starting then uses the displayed destination.
- `test/harness_placement_test.dart`, `test/box_flows_test.dart`,
  `test/harness_store_entry_test.dart`: pinned creation, keyboard routing,
  cancellation, pending starts, tab allocation, source context, and capacity
  and existing-pane actions after changing a picker's destination.
- `test/models_menu_test.dart`: the native Models menu uses the product dock
  on its explicitly chosen machine; an uninstalled product opens its Store page.
- `test/generated_project_launch_test.dart` and
  `test/new_harness_project_context_test.dart`: generated versus edited names,
  collisions, delayed replies, and machine-specific project choices.
- `integration_test/native_workspace_e2e_test.dart`: native onboarding,
  Cmd-T/Cmd-P creation, edited defaults, Store product switching for Open/Try,
  the Models menu, and terminal input immediately after starting without a
  mouse click. Creation journeys also switch and repeat shortcuts while a task
  is already typed into the picker.

Native fixtures use fake transport and injected Flutter keys. They do not start
live harnesses or establish physical AppKit/IME behavior.
