# New Harness entry rules

Presentation follows the [terminal dialog design system](terminal-dialogs.md).
Use that guide for current visuals; this document owns entry and launch behavior.

Startup and Cmd-T show the same quiet welcome page. Cmd-T creates a blank tab;
Escape leaves that tab open. The command dock opens only after an explicit
Cmd-N, Cmd-O, or Cmd-P action. Start Harness submits the reviewed draft;
opening or cancelling the dock never starts a harness.

The compact, centered launch form starts with `New Harness` selected.
Agent, Project, and collapsed Options are the main rows. Options expands Model,
Approvals, applicable Profile, Branch, and Worktree in consecutive rows. Enter launches
using the displayed settings. The launch action follows the fields with one blank row
and no extra shortcut hint. Enter on the selected action launches; there is no
Shift-Enter shortcut. Carried tasks remain in the draft.

Up/Down moves between fields and automatically reveals that field's chooser to
the right, without moving the form. Right, typing, or Enter moves keyboard focus
into the chooser. Enter accepts a value and returns focus to New Harness; a
second Enter launches. Escape discards the search and returns to the form.
Tab and Shift-Tab switch between the form and its chooser without applying a
choice; Up/Down navigates the active pane, matching Cmd-P and Cmd-I.
There is no summary pane. Agent combines coding agents and specialized
harnesses in one list. Choosing Blender opens a compatible coding-agent list
in the chooser. Project
searches all machine/folder pairs, local first, with unavailable destinations
dimmed. Choosing a pair sets both the machine and project. New Folder, Open
Folder, and Clone Repository first ask for a machine, with local preselected,
then show their name, path/browser, or URL prompt. Escape retraces these steps.
Project displays `machine:full-path`; there is no separate Machine row.

Use the terminal's selected font and measured cells. All controls are plain
text, with one-row highlights. Worktree uses `[x]` / `[ ]`. Narrow windows show
the active list on the same column with its own height. Validation messages have
their own whole rows. The chooser starts with search, without
a back/title row; Left or Escape returns to the form. Opening, searching, and cancelling
never send input to an existing harness or start one.

| Entry | Initial values | Destination after a successful start |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cmd-T, then Cmd-N | Last successful agent, local machine, last project on that machine | The blank tab opened by Cmd-T |
| Cmd-Shift-P → New Harness | Last successful agent, local machine, last project on that machine | Current tab |
| Cmd-N or the New Harness command | Last successful agent, local machine, last project on that machine; retain explicit task and destination | Current tab unless its source requests a new tab |
| Explicit pane split | Focused pane's defaults | Requested split in that tab |
| Store New Harness, or a product's Open action in the pane or native Models menu | Explicit product and machine; suggested project named for that product | New tab |
| Store Resume Harness | Existing harness and its machine; choose from a menu when several match | Focus its existing tab or reopen a view of the same harness |
| Store Try this prompt | Same as Open, with the example as the editable task | New tab |
| First empty workspace | No automatic action; show the welcome page | User chooses with Cmd-N, Cmd-O, or Cmd-S |

The Store and orchestration tabs cannot host a terminal pane. Generic creation
from either uses a new tab. Command-bar requests keep the workspace context and
apply any agent or machine explicitly named by the request.

The unified picker has search and results on the left, with details and inline
management controls on the right. Enter opens a harness, uses or gets a model,
or focuses a machine's controls. Projects drill into their session lists. Cmd-P never offers New
Harness, including when no sessions match or a scoped list is empty. Cmd-N opens
creation explicitly. Cmd-Shift-P searches named
commands for the selected resource and returns to the same search after an action
or cancellation. Each item action names its target, which is revalidated before
execution. Filters and sorting are explicit commands, with no More menu.

Workspace panes remain terminals, with viewers as the only exception. Model,
machine, and API management stays inside the picker. Tab switches panes;
arrows navigate within the active pane and Enter activates the focused item.

## Harness and agent choices

Agent lists recent specialized harnesses, direct coding agents, installed
harnesses, and the rest of the machine's catalog, followed by Browse Harness
Store. All are searchable. Codex, Claude Code, and Terminal are direct choices;
there is no separate Coding category. A specialized harness asks which compatible
coding agent should run it, preselecting its remembered choice. The form's value
then reads `Blender · Codex`. Choosing a direct agent removes the package choice
and sends no `dsh`; it does not remove project instructions or skills.

Explicit entry choices and pending receipts win over remembered defaults. A
remembered agent, package, project, or profile that is unavailable requires an
explicit replacement. A package requested explicitly keeps its identity. Packages
offered by the machine can install when started; the dialog narrates installation and
failure details. Another agent or project machine clears that narration.
Machine changes re-evaluate compatibility and never silently substitute at
launch. The installed package's compatibility takes precedence over a newer
catalog listing.

The existing local state store retains separate engine and harness recents and
the last successful engine per harness. Legacy preference keys and the app data
directory stay in place. Fresh forms use successful launches, not canceled edits.

## Model selection

Model lives under Options and uses the chosen agent’s supported routes. Show the
selected model name, or its provider (OpenAI / Anthropic) when the launch model
is not reported. Its picker reuses the Models menu's subscription usage
source and the selected machine's model catalog. It shows the relevant
subscription/default login, running models on the person's machines, and shared
models grouped by grid. Each model identifies its serving machine; search matches
that machine too. Two grids serving the same model id remain distinct choices.

Machine identifies where the agent, project and tools run. The model can be
served from a different machine. Changing Machine or Agent preserves an explicit
model, refreshes availability, and blocks Start with an explanation if the new
combination is unavailable. It never substitutes a subscription. Refresh models
updates the choices; Manage Models opens the existing Models panel for lifecycle
management and preserves the launch draft. Choosing Terminal clears model routing;
its Model row is omitted.

An explicit model survives draft dismissal/restoration and uncertain creation
receipts. A new session starts with the selected engine's default subscription;
model routing is not persisted as a global preference. Start refreshes availability
and sends only `gridModel` and `gridName`; the selected machine resolves the endpoint
and credentials. Older daemons without `supportsModelLaunch` explain that an update
is needed while continuing to allow ordinary subscription launches.

## Git projects

Git projects enable Branch and Worktree. Worktree defaults to **Yes**;
Enter, Space, Left/Right, Page Up/Down, or a click toggles `[x]` and `[ ]`.
An empty repository explains that a commit is required for a worktree and asks
for a choice. Folders without Git keep both rows disabled. Discovery runs on the selected machine
without fetching, switching branches, or creating a worktree. A failed
discovery offers Retry and blocks starting until the result is known.

A worktree is a temporary folder, never a project: a harness is known by the
folder it was started in and its repository's branch. Pane headers read
`folder › branch`, with the machine first only for another computer: the folder
the harness started in (a subfolder as itself, a checkout's root — a
worktree's too — as its repository), which does not follow the agent's shell,
and the branch with the same icon everywhere. A checkout on no branch — a
commit an agent checked out to read or test — shows no branch; the tooltip says
`No branch: on commit 65281563`. Worktree folders are never shown; the header's
tooltip has the full path. Cut short, the folder shortens in the
middle before the branch does. A folder inside a linked
worktree (the focused pane's, or one typed or browsed) shows as the same folder
in the repository's main checkout, so Cmd-N from a worktree pane starts beside
it rather than inside it. Worktrees Start made are never offered as recent
projects.

**Branch** starts on `main` (local, or `origin/main`) with Worktree on, and on the
folder's own branch after the user turns Worktree off. Missing `main` requires
an explicit branch choice; a failed worktree creation never silently turns
Worktree off. Branch does not follow the pane New Harness was opened from:
New Harness is new work, and another agent's branch is one pick away. The start
action reads **New Harness**, whatever the rows say.
The picker names local branches; a remote branch is listed only when no local
branch has its name.

With **Yes**, **Branch** is what the new worktree works from. At Start a new
branch starts from the newer of that branch and its upstream, fetched for at
most ten seconds: `main` behind `origin/main` starts from `origin/main`, and
`main` with commits of its own starts from `main`, so nothing is lost; offline,
it starts from the last fetch. The branch the harness works on follows from it, with no row of its
own: the default or current branch gets a new branch named after the session
(`onboarding-experience`);
another local branch is checked out as it is; a remote branch nobody has
locally becomes a local branch of the same name tracking it; a branch that
already has a worktree opens there, as the Branch row's tooltip says. The
project folder's own branch cannot be checked out twice. Typing a name no
branch has offers **Create branch**: a new branch in a new worktree, from the
default branch. Spaces become `-` and anything Git refuses in a name is
dropped.

A session has no name at Start, so that branch starts as a made-up
`<word>-<word>`, marked `branch.<name>.harness = placeholder` in the
repository's config and left out of the pane header. The daemon renames it once,
to one or two words of the session's name, when the session first has a name.
Filler words and a leading verb are dropped, and a generic second word (page,
flow, experience, issue…) is too: `Fix the harness list order` becomes
`harness-list`, `Fix the login page` becomes `login`. A taken name falls back to
the two-word one (`login-page`), then adds the title's next telling word
(`harness-monitor-ddos`), and only then numbers the shortest (`login-2`). Local
and remote branches both count, without regard to case, and a repository's own
names (`main`, `master`, `head`, `origin`, `develop`…) are always taken. It is
renamed only that once, and never again:
not after a later session name, a push, or a rename by the person or the agent.
A picked or created branch keeps its name. The worktree is checked out in
`~/harnesses/worktrees/<repository>/<branch>`, and ignored files listed in the
repository's `.worktreeinclude` (gitignore syntax, e.g. `.env`) are copied in.

With **No**, **Branch** is the branch the folder itself is on; only local
branches are selectable. A branch with a worktree of its own opens there.
Typing a name no branch has offers **Create branch**:
a new branch from the folder's branch, keeping its uncommitted changes.
Switching or creating needs no harness working in the folder, and switching
also needs nothing uncommitted. No changes are forced,
stashed, or discarded. A selected subfolder follows into a new worktree only if
it exists in that commit.

The picker displays branch names on one line; metadata such as `default`,
`current`, `worktree`, and `remote` remains searchable. It leaves out branches Harness made (marked `branch.<name>.harness`, or named
`harness/…` by older builds) whose worktree is gone. The daemon removes a
worktree it finds in `~/harnesses/worktrees` only when no live or stopped
harness uses it, nothing is uncommitted, and it has been idle for a week; the
branch stays unless Harness made it and its commits are all elsewhere.

Drafts preserve these choices. A lost start reply reuses
its receipt, and retrying a confirmed launch failure reuses its prepared
worktree: the retry selects that worktree's branch with Worktree off.

## Draft ownership

- Workspace drafts belong to their original machine, focused source harness,
  and project context. A different focused harness does not inherit their edits.
- Fresh Cmd-N and Cmd-Shift-P creation use the same successful-launch defaults.
  The current tab controls placement; a saved draft cannot redirect it to an old destination.
- Store drafts belong to the explicitly requested product and machine. Opening
  Blender cannot restore Workshop's agent, task, or generated project name.
- Escape discards ordinary Cmd-N edits. Explicit Store entries can resume their
  compatible draft, including the selected agent. Store Open still wins if the
  harness or machine was changed inside that saved draft.
- A newly typed search task or Store example starts from that entry's defaults.
  Repeating the same request while its draft is already open keeps its edits.
- A request awaiting confirmation is an exception: restore its exact values and
  receipt. A new task must not silently turn an uncertain start into a duplicate.
  An in-flight or uncertain draft cannot be replaced while it is open.
- Closing the dock does not discard unresolved receipts. Advanced options and
  return-to-dock preserve the same draft ownership and placement.

## Project names

Suggested projects display the existing `<agent>-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM` naming
convention. Untouched suggestions follow agent changes; a user's edited name
does not. The suggestion is frozen while reviewed. Project → New Folder
asks for a machine, then opens the name prompt; accepting a name returns to the Project field.

Each machine retains its own project choice. A folder on one machine is never
silently reused on another. Generated folders use exclusive reservation and
advance to seconds/a suffix only on a confirmed collision. Explicit names are
never silently renamed, and existing files are never overwritten.

## Regression coverage

`tool/check_new_harness_coverage.mjs` requires 100% executable-line coverage of
the complete `lib/state/new_harness.dart` and `lib/widgets/new_harness_form.dart`
modules, including the install clock. Neither module excludes lines from coverage.
After running tests with `flutter test --coverage --branch-coverage`, run
`node tool/check_new_harness_coverage.mjs coverage/lcov.info`. This is a line
coverage gate; branch coverage and the native fixtures provide additional evidence,
not a guarantee about every possible external machine or agent failure.

- `test/new_harness_controller_edges_test.dart`: late discovery, unavailable
  main, conflicting worktrees, profile validation/link errors, stale choices,
  generated-name collisions, bounded folder caches, and lost creation receipts.
- `test/new_harness_scenarios_test.dart`: keyboard and pointer parity, Unicode
  editing and composition, unavailable replacements, long errors, small windows,
  delayed folder/browser/launch replies, and callbacks after form disposal.

- `test/new_harness_git_test.dart`, `test/git_worktree_test.dart`, and
  `test/git_worktree_failures_test.dart`: Git defaults, disabled non-Git rows,
  keyboard/click toggles, branch search, branch resolution, stale
  replies, retries, actual Git worktrees and branch safety, fetching,
  tracking, `.worktreeinclude`, process deadlines, and bounded output.
  `cli/src/lib/gitProject.spec.ts` and `worktreeSweep.spec.ts` cover the same
  rules on a remote machine and the daemon's cleanup.
- `test/new_harness_entry_rules_test.dart`: product changes with an open or
  dismissed dock, Open/Try, edited names, machine changes, explicit agent
  precedence, search isolation, exact launch payloads, pending receipts, source
  pane changes, and Cmd-N/Cmd-Shift-P draft recovery and placement. Repeated/switched
  shortcuts retain typed tasks, text selection, existing results, and project
  scope; starting then uses the displayed destination.
- `test/harness_placement_test.dart`, `test/box_flows_test.dart`,
  `test/harness_store_entry_test.dart`: pinned creation, keyboard routing,
  cancellation, pending starts, tab allocation, source context, and capacity
  and existing-pane actions after changing a picker's destination.
- `test/models_menu_test.dart`: the native Models menu uses the product dock
  on its explicitly chosen machine; an uninstalled product opens its Store page.
- `test/new_harness_models_test.dart`: subscription relevance, local/shared model
  identity, independent agent/model machines, stopped models, old/offline daemons,
  stale asynchronous responses, pending receipts, draft restoration, and wide and
  compact keyboard/pointer flows. `cli/src/backendSocket.models.spec.ts` and
  `cli/src/lib/newAgentModel.spec.ts` cover daemon resolution and receipt semantics.
- `test/generated_project_launch_test.dart` and
  `test/new_harness_project_context_test.dart`: generated versus edited names,
  collisions, delayed replies, and machine-specific project choices.
- `integration_test/native_workspace_e2e_test.dart`: native onboarding,
  Cmd-T/Cmd-Shift-P creation, edited defaults, Store product switching for Open/Try,
  the Models menu, and terminal input immediately after starting without a
  mouse click. Creation journeys also switch and repeat shortcuts while a task
  is already typed into the picker.

Native fixtures use fake transport and injected Flutter keys. They do not start
live harnesses or establish physical AppKit/IME behavior.
