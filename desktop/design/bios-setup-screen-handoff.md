# New Harness setup and minimal Open Harness picker — handoff

For current dialog presentation, follow the
[terminal dialog design system](terminal-dialogs.md). The 2026-09-24 review
supersedes this handoff's older logo, selection, spacing, and color directions.

Branch: `feat/centered-new-harness-palette`. Updated 2026-09-23.

## Latest review direction

The user reviewed the first BIOS version of ⌘O and explicitly asked to remove
`Harness:` labels, brackets and all arrow instructions, pointing to fzf in Vim:
"clean, minimal but functional. less is better". **This supersedes the BIOS
presentation requirements for Open Harness below.** The first simplification
was too sparse; the user then requested machine, repository, branch and last
activity, and asked that New Harness look different from session names.

The final ⌘O list has a plain title and subdued highlight, a small engine mark,
a machine/repository/branch line, and elapsed activity at the right.
New Harness is a plus-marked action separated from sessions by a rule.
The next review removed the match count entirely and asked for typography
and spacing identical to the terminal. Titles, metadata, activity, input and
preview now use the renderer's selected face, size and line height, with no
inherited UI tracking. Secondary details and their glyphs are muted gray,
without the repository/branch accent colors. The preview stays available.
The subsequent review found the rows too crowded. Sessions now have 12 px
above and below their two text lines and a 4 px title/context gap, with wider
horizontal insets. The preview uses 24 px margins and section separation;
terminal font metrics remain unchanged.
The latest review asked why the visible ages were out of order. ⌘O now sorts
by the displayed last-activity timestamp, newest first, rather than by opening
history. Filtering retains that order, and catalog updates retain the selected
session. Unknown timestamps follow dated sessions; visit history only breaks
ties. Search remains at the top.

The user approved ⌘O's UI/UX and asked to carry its typography, spacing and
colors to ⌘N. Creation shares its terminal font metrics, muted labels,
generous padding and subdued selection. The subsequent review asked for
less unused space: ⌘N now has its own 960 × 480 frame, growing by up to 25%
with larger terminal text and clamping to the window. Fields and choices
use a 55:45 split while retaining their row spacing. Field values have no
brackets or punctuation; the start action has a plus mark and accent.
The arrow legend and More options / F2 footer are gone, including the
hard-coded F2 shortcut. The existing remappable Cmd+. advanced-form action
remains available. Wide windows keep fields and choices side by side;
narrow windows give the active list full width with a back action. Search
stays above its scrolling choices. Field/value clicks work alongside the
existing keyboard contract.
The next refinement makes project, machine, branch and approval choices a
single line. Machines show their names; only the local machine has a muted **This machine**
note. Folder paths and branch metadata remain searchable without being
printed below every choice. Profile appears only for the selected agent when
it uses Codex profiles; merely browsing other agents does not move the fields.
Field navigation skips the hidden Profile row in both directions.

The latest review adds icons to Clone Repository, Open Folder, and New Project.
Open Folder leads to the short Folder path prompt with a Browse Folder action.
GitHub URL and Project name prompts are short too. Pasting works with Cmd-V or
Ctrl-V, and accepted paths, URLs, and names return to Project. Delayed clipboard
replies cannot overwrite a different field or newly typed input. Backspace
removes a complete Unicode character. The idle right pane has no highlight;
the active list keeps its keyboard highlight. The cursor sits beside its hint
without an extra space. Pending Git discovery does not flash a false non-Git
message. Unavailable choices explain why they cannot be used.
This supersedes the historical BIOS presentation described below.

## Latest verification and native review

See [picker-verification.md](picker-verification.md) for scenario coverage,
measured line coverage, native observations, artifacts and remaining limits.
The user has requested PR creation and merge after verification.

Integrated current main `306cbfdd` and checked the resulting branch:

- Full desktop suite: **3,116 passed, 12 skipped, 17 failed**. All 17 failures
  reproduce on main (48 passing cases in those same six files); no loader
  failures or additional failed test names.
- Affected randomized runs: **260 passed** at each of seeds 924 and 925,
  **51 Cmd-P checks passed** at seed 926, **284 passed** at seed 927, and
  **295 passed** after final integration at seed 928.
- **Nine native macOS fixtures passed** after integration, using an isolated
  test bundle with fake transports. Models now opens its overview without
  launching the pending product, matching current main.
- Full analysis matches main's 15 existing findings. Final fixture analysis
  reports no issues; changed Dart files are formatted.
- The optional render walkthrough passed and generated 133 synthetic images.
- New Harness form coverage is **97.6%**; controller coverage is **93.7%**.
  This is not 100% coverage or a zero-bug guarantee.
- On-demand CLI CI failures also reproduce on main; this branch has no CLI or
  workflow changes. Details and run links are in the verification record.
- Normal macOS build 9 succeeded (`harness-picker-review-build-9.log`).

The repeat audit added 37 regressions covering composition, native command
routing, folder-browser failures, first-key editing, delayed clipboard replies,
Git/install failure and retry, duplicate creation, disposal, command handoff
and unmatched command searches. Cmd-O branch widths use measured content,
including inherited text styles, so a branch uses the available row space.

Computer use confirmed the field/action alignment, scrolling, single-line
choices, each agent's approval options, conditional Profile, machine labels,
Worktree activation, project prompt acceptance, and Cmd-P execution and
cancellation. An approved real plain Terminal was started in `/private/tmp`,
verified with `pwd`, then exited. Physical Cmd-V and IME delivery remain
unverified by the automation; native context-menu paste worked. Live credential
profile actions were blocked by review and are covered only by fake fixtures.

The latest quit/restart was blocked by approval review because an active
conversation had unconfirmed saved state. The existing review process remains
open, and build 9 is ready for its next restart. Native fixtures instead ran
as Harness Picker Verification in an isolated copy; that process has exited.
Earlier cleanup also closed an existing Office Untitled Tab. Its requested
restoration remains incomplete after review blocked identifying/reopening the
matching session; the verification record preserves the details.

## Why this exists

The team said the bottom command dock was "too hard to use": every answer was
a trip into a sub-list and back. The replacement is a **BIOS setup utility** —
one screen holding every answer, changed where it stands, keyboard only.

That reference was chosen deliberately and researched. What separates a BIOS
screen from an ncurses dialog is that **the screen is the chrome**: values sit
bracketed at a fixed column, the selection is inverse video rather than a
marker glyph, the key legend never moves, and nothing is a button. `dialog`,
`whiptail` and `menuconfig` read as TUI rather than BIOS precisely because
they are a centred rounded box with a drop shadow and `<Select> <Exit>`.

Three earlier designs were rejected, and the reasons still apply:

- **A unified fuzzy list** where Return means "start" on one row and "set" on
  another. Same key, two verbs, one surface. This is Spotlight behaviour, not
  fzf behaviour.
- **A shell-style command line** (`claude ~/code/foo -b main -w`). It looks
  like a shell, so it inherits a contract it cannot honour — people reach for
  `Ctrl-R`, `!$`, globs, history. k9s users filed exactly that request against
  its `:` prompt. Positional grammar also cannot work here: branch candidates
  depend on which project is selected, so `-b main` cannot be typed before the
  project resolves.
- **Phoenix's `-`/`+` for changing values.** Folder and branch names are full
  of hyphens; a screen that swallows one to nudge a value is broken for the
  thing people type most. `PgUp`/`PgDn` keep the convention instead.

## The key model (do not quietly change this)

| Key | On the items | With the list live |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `↑↓` | move between rows | move within the list |
| `→` | **hand the keys to the right column** (Worktree: flip it) | move the caret |
| `←` | — (Worktree: flip it) | empty search: **back to the items**; otherwise move the caret |
| `PgDn` `PgUp` | change the focused value in place | — |
| `↵` | hand the keys to the right column | take the value |
| `Esc` | close | back to the items |
| `Tab` | walk the rows | walk the list |
| typing | fuzzy search the focused row | narrow further |

**Changed 2026-09-24, on the owner's request, and loudly rather than
quietly.** The arrows used to change the focused value where it stood, the way
a BIOS screen does, and `↵` alone handed the keys across. But this screen is
two columns side by side, which a BIOS is not: people read the choices on the
right and reach for `→` to get at them, and what they got instead was the
value on the LEFT changing under them. `→` now goes where the eye already
went. Stepping a value in place keeps `PgUp`/`PgDn`, which this document
already picked for it, and `↵` is unchanged so nobody's hands have to be
re-taught. Worktree is the one exception both arrows keep: two values and
nothing to browse, so there is no column to go to (and
`new-harness-entry-rules.md` still describes it exactly as before).

Two rules hold it together:

1. **Only `New Harness` starts an agent.** Return on a value row never
   launches. This was an explicit request after a stray Return started work.
2. **The selection bar marks which column has the keys.** The 12% white fill is
   where the arrows are. The idle right pane has no fill; the left field stays
   faintly marked while its list is active. The idle column's text greys out too. A test
   counts the active bars and asserts there is never more than one.

`Tab` is handled explicitly because unhandled it runs Flutter's focus
traversal, which moves focus *out* of the form and leaves it deaf to every
later key. That looked like a freeze and took a while to find.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/widgets/new_harness_form.dart` | The whole ⌘N screen. New. |
| `lib/state/new_harness.dart` | `stepValues()` and `applyOption()` added; rest untouched. |
| `lib/screens/swarm_screen.dart` | Mounts the form; ⌘O overlay geometry and scrim. |
| `lib/widgets/swarm_switcher.dart` | ⌘O results/preview split. |
| `lib/widgets/box_chrome.dart` | Shared UI styles stay fixed; terminal surfaces opt into `terminalTextStyle`. |
| `test/new_harness_form_test.dart` | 32 tests, all key paths. New. |

### The one controller subtlety

`stepValues()` returns a field's values in a **stable** order. The displayed
list re-ranks the chosen row to the front, so stepping through *that* by index
walks in circles — right always took the second row, left always wrapped to
the last. The form captures a wheel on focus and steps through that instead.

Synthetic rows are not all the same thing. `Clone`, `Open Folder`,
`New Project` and `Change Machine` are **doors**: they open a prompt or the
system chooser. `Create branch x` is synthetic too and is a genuine **answer**.
`_doors` names them explicitly; inferring from `synthetic` broke branch
creation.

## Implemented in this pass

- Deleted the unused `NewHarnessBox` and `CommandDock`; migrated launch tests
  and benchmarks to the real setup form, explicit field selection and launch.
- Connected advanced options, Store, profile linking and folder browsing to
  the form. Fixed initial parent notification during build, prompt Escape,
  focus return after browsing, busy/pending dismissal, and scrolling to the
  selected field at large text sizes. Creation errors are visible live regions.
- Added flat activity ordering for ⌘O, retaining command, group and split ordering.
  The old handoff pointed at `rankSwarmLocations`, but the live ⌘O path uses
  the placement/add catalog. `activityFirst` applies the ordering there;
  the navigation-only path remains unchanged. Controller coverage verifies
  activity order while filtering, discovery refreshes and live preview matches,
  while ordinary search retains relevance ranking.
- Simplified ⌘O after user review: no type labels, brackets or persistent key
  legend. Titles have a compact identity line and elapsed activity; New Harness
  is a distinct plus action. A block cursor and preview remain; the match
  count was removed in the latest review.
  Cached rows retain search emphasis and full accessible context. Tab stays
  inside the list; narrow windows prioritize results over the preview.
  Activity comes from the catalog agent's `lastActivityAt` and refreshes once
  a minute while the picker is open; missing timestamps remain blank.
- Restored fixed shared dialog typography. New Harness, Open Harness and its
  preview opt into the terminal font/size. The remote folder browser opened
  from New Harness opts in too; the OS folder chooser remains native.

## Verification and review

A normal macOS debug app is built from `lib/main.dart` at
`desktop/build/macos/Build/Products/Debug/Harness.app`. The user authorized
restarting the live app with this branch build; existing tabs were restored.
At that earlier review stage, commit/push/merge had not yet been requested;
the latest instruction authorizes the PR and merge after verification.

Production Dart analysis reports no issues. The final full run reported 21
failures: 17 pre-existing CLI daemon/sign-out/expiry/environment failures,
plus four picker assertions affected by the last visual simplification.
Those four were corrected and their files rerun successfully: 12 layout,
keyboard and capture checks, and 5 catalog/metadata checks passed. The full
run is `/private/tmp/harness-minimal-verification.jsonl`; follow-up results
are `/private/tmp/harness-minimal-layout-tests.jsonl` and
`/private/tmp/harness-minimal-catalog-tests.jsonl`. The earlier targeted run
also passed all 114 keyboard, rendering, accessibility and MRU tests before
the final visual simplification. No failing tests were disabled.

The subsequent context/activity refinement is verified separately in
`/private/tmp/harness-context-tests.jsonl` and
`/private/tmp/harness-context-action-test.jsonl`. Real-font snapshots cover
normal and narrow windows and enlarged text in `/private/tmp/harness-context-review/`.
The latest typography/count/color refinement passed all 79 affected checks in
`/private/tmp/harness-neutral-tests.jsonl` and has captures in
`/private/tmp/harness-neutral-review/`. Build evidence is
`/private/tmp/harness-neutral-build.log`; production analysis is
`/private/tmp/harness-neutral-analysis.txt`.
The spacing follow-up passed all 47 affected checks in
`/private/tmp/harness-spacing-tests.jsonl`, with normal/narrow/enlarged-font
captures in `/private/tmp/harness-spacing-review/`. Its debug build succeeded
(`/private/tmp/harness-spacing-build.log`), and production analysis reports
no issues (`/private/tmp/harness-spacing-analysis.txt`). `git diff --check` passes.
The activity-order correction passed all 54 affected checks in
`/private/tmp/harness-activity-sort-tests.jsonl`. The review build and production
analysis succeeded (`/private/tmp/harness-activity-sort-build.log` and
`/private/tmp/harness-activity-sort-analysis.txt`).
Native review confirms ascending displayed ages (0m, 0m, 0m, 9m, 1h, 1h, 2h…).
That activity-sort review ran alongside `/Applications/Harness.app`; automatic
approval review blocked quitting that separate installed instance, so it was
left running.

The ⌘N styling pass is captured at normal/narrow widths and 2× text in
`/private/tmp/harness-new-style-review/`. The affected form, keyboard, layout,
accessibility, project/profile and placement checks passed after updating
assertions for plain values and explicit choice focus. Results are in
`/private/tmp/harness-new-style-tests.jsonl` (initial run),
`/private/tmp/harness-new-style-followup-tests.jsonl` (remaining files), and
`/private/tmp/harness-new-style-project-tests.jsonl` (final project assertions).
Production analysis has no issues (`/private/tmp/harness-new-style-analysis.txt`)
and the debug build succeeded (`/private/tmp/harness-new-style-build.log`).
The branch review app has been restarted with the matching ⌘N presentation.

The compact ⌘N follow-up passed 47 affected checks in
`/private/tmp/harness-compact-new-tests.jsonl`, with normal/narrow/enlarged-font
captures in `/private/tmp/harness-compact-new-review/`. Production analysis
has no issues (`/private/tmp/harness-compact-new-analysis.txt`) and the debug
build succeeded (`/private/tmp/harness-compact-new-build.log`). After the user
confirmed the restart, the branch app was reopened with the rebuilt executable.
Native review confirms the compact frame, preserved field spacing and removed
More options / F2 footer. The app is left on ⌘N for review.

The single-line choices and conditional Profile pass completed 66 affected
checks (`/private/tmp/harness-single-line-tests.jsonl`), including changing
agents without moving fields while browsing and skipping the hidden Profile
row during keyboard navigation. Normal and enlarged-text captures are in
`/private/tmp/harness-single-line-review/`. Production analysis has no issues
(`/private/tmp/harness-single-line-analysis.txt`) and the macOS debug build
succeeded (`/private/tmp/harness-single-line-build.log`).
The branch app was restarted under the user's review-build authorization.
Native review confirms single-line projects, machine names with inline Remote
notes, and no Profile row for Claude Code. ⌘N is open on Machine for review.

## Two process notes that cost real time

- **Write the widget test before rebuilding.** Every bug the user found by
  hand — arrows not stepping, search looking broken, the list not moving — was
  reachable from a test that sends real key events. The first such test caught
  six failures in one run, three of which had already been reported.
- **Scripted `str.replace` edits must assert their anchor.** Three silently
  matched nothing after an earlier edit moved the text, so changes were
  reported that never reached the file, and the wrong code got debugged.
