/// ⚠️ THESE ARE NOW ADAPTERS, NOT VALUES, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Every one of

/// this palette and still paint a dark window while the rest of the app went
/// light: a constant cannot answer "which theme is it".
///
/// Each name below resolves through [grid.AppPalette], the design system that
/// already carries a light and a dark value for every role — and carries the
/// contrast ratio it was chosen for, in a comment, next to it. Mapping onto it
/// rather than inventing a second light palette is deliberate: two palettes for
/// one app do not stay in agreement, and the one that drifts is always the one
/// nobody is looking at.
///
/// The DARK values are unchanged in spirit but no longer identical — they are
/// now whatever the design system says dark is, so the two halves of the app
/// stop disagreeing by a few points of grey along the seam between them.
///
/// Being getters, they cannot appear in a `const` expression. That is a feature:
/// the compiler names every site that froze a colour at build time, which is
/// exactly the set of places light mode would otherwise have missed.
