/// Runs the Harness CLI owned by this desktop app without depending on a
/// terminal shell, its rc files, or Finder's inherited PATH.
///
/// The normal path is the managed tier: `~/.harness/runtime/current-node` — a
/// private, checksum-verified Node that the `harness` installer provisions and
/// records — paired with the `~/.harness/cli/cli.js` bundle,
/// invoked as `<node> <cli.js> …` with no shell in between. Because both are
/// absolute paths beneath [harnessHome], launching Harness from Finder and from
/// Terminal have identical runtime behavior; PATH never enters into it.
///
/// On macOS and Linux, behind that come the installed
/// `~/.local/bin/harness` launcher and finally bare `harness` on PATH, which
/// cover a developer-managed install and the window before the first
/// provisioning run has finished.
///
/// ## Windows
///
/// **The CLI runs in WSL2.** Its managed runtime is published for
/// macOS and Linux only and its installer is a POSIX script, so a Windows host
/// runs the CLI inside a named development distro and Windows 11 forwards
/// loopback into it (see [WslRuntime]). This resolves to
/// `wsl.exe -d <distro> -- bash -lc 'exec "$HOME/.local/bin/harness" "$@"' …`
/// rather than to a native managed runtime, launcher, or bare name. The CLI's
/// only supported terminal backend is tmux, which is unavailable natively on
/// Windows, so a native executable answering `version` is not a usable desktop
/// backend.
///
/// **A bare `harness` must never be spawned on Windows.** CreateProcess
/// searches the CALLING EXECUTABLE'S OWN DIRECTORY before PATH, so a release
/// build named `harness.exe` asking for `harness` starts a copy of itself —
/// observed here as a spawn storm of a dozen app instances, each one running
/// the same provisioning probe that spawned the last. Windows resolution
/// therefore returns either an explicit `wsl.exe` invocation or a name that
/// cannot exist — a clean `ProcessException`, which every caller already treats
/// as \"the CLI is not there\".
