/// The three provider stores as one thing the panel can listen to.
///
/// Thin on purpose: every decision worth testing lives in `usage_overview.dart`
/// (the arithmetic) or `usage_ledger_store.dart` (the lifecycle). This owns only
/// the fan-out — one listener per store, one notification out — so a widget does
/// not have to hold three `ListenableBuilder`s and re-derive the overview in
/// each of them.
///
/// ⚠️ **Nothing here polls.** `UsageController` beside it runs a 60-second timer
/// because a rate limit moves on its own; a ledger moves only when an agent
/// writes to this disk, and a full rescan walks every transcript on the machine.
/// So this scans when the panel opens and when somebody asks — and
/// `kLedgerStaleAfter` keeps even that from re-walking the disk on every visit.
