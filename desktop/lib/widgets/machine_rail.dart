/// landed on the least useful words on screen. And an accent-washed button, which in a rail holding no
/// other framed control read as the primary action of the whole window for a machine that is merely
/// idle. Neither said the thing that matters, which is that a row can be added here.
///
/// It also stands at the END of a machine that already has agents, and that is not scope creep — it is
/// the same problem one row further down. Adding an agent to a machine that has some is only offered by
