# CAD Viewer, as a Harness viewer package

The 3D pane for CAD agents in [Harness](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness):
Jake's **CAD Viewer** from [earthtojake/text-to-cad](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad),
run from the `cadgen` release it ships in, unchanged. Any harness points at it with

```json
"viewer": { "use": "autonomous/cad-viewer" }
```

and gets the pane beside its terminal: STEP, GLB, glTF, STL, 3MF, DXF, URDF, SRDF and SDF, with
MoveIt2 inverse kinematics for robots. `?file=` follows the artifact the harness's verdict names.

This package is a viewer, not an agent: it has no engine, no workspace and no verdict, and it is
never a tile. It is installed once per machine and shared by every harness that uses it.

- `harness.json` — the manifest (spec 1.1, `kind: viewer`).
- `setup.sh` — one venv with the pinned `cadgen` (see `CADGEN_VERSION`); pulls OpenCascade. The venv is on
  Python 3.12, which uv downloads when the machine has none (`runtimes.sh`, the store's shared copy).
- `doctor.sh` — can this machine run it.
- `viewer.sh` — `cadgen viewer --host 127.0.0.1 --port $HARNESS_VIEWER_PORT` in the workspace. The
  viewer already follows the agent: a re-export of the open file redraws in place and keeps the
  camera, and Measure, Display (clip planes on X/Y/Z, exploded view, render mode) and Reference
  are in the inspector.
- `pane_client.py` — the client the pane serves, through cadgen's own `--dist` option: the pinned
  release's bundled client, byte for byte, plus one `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag in
  `index.html` that keeps the page's fetches on loopback. Without it the page asks api.github.com
  for a newer release on every open and shows an **Update** link to a version the pane cannot
  install; with it the corner shows the pinned version. Made once per cadgen version, gitignored.

## Credit and stewardship

The CAD Viewer is Jake Fitzgerald's: part of `cadgen` from [earthtojake/text-to-cad](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad), MIT, copyright 2026 Thompson Labs LLC (`LICENSE-cadgen`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`). Nothing of it is changed here.
This folder is the Harness wrapper — the manifest and three shell scripts — written by Autonomous to bring the CAD Viewer into
Harness. We did that work on the project's behalf, to bootstrap the catalogue; the credit for what
the agent can do belongs upstream.

If you maintain the CAD Viewer and want to own its Harness package, it is yours: open an issue on
[OpenHarness](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness/issues) and we move this folder into a
repository of yours and point the registry entry at it. Until then: bugs in the CAD Viewer belong upstream, bugs in the
wrapper belong here, and a newer release is a bump of `CADGEN_VERSION`.

```sh
harness dsh check .           # conformance
harness dsh install "$PWD" --link # this checkout as the installed viewer
python3 -m unittest discover -s test  # pane_client.py and the three scripts, against a stand-in cadgen
```
