# MuJoCo Viewer, a Harness viewer package

The pane for robots in motion in [Harness](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness):
MuJoCo's `simulate`, in the browser. The model the agent simulated is compiled and **run live** by
MuJoCo's own WebAssembly build and drawn with three.js the way `simulate` draws it — the model's
skybox, its checker floor with reflections and shadows, its lights. It opens on the live simulation,
always: from the rollout's first frame with the controls the agent's controller produced, so the robot
does what it did — and keeps going, and reacts when you push it. The recording is one click away as a
frame-exact replay, and the video, when there is one, is a tab, never the default.

A harness points at it with

```json
"viewer": { "use": "autonomous/mujoco-viewer" }
```

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Simulate** (`S`) | live `mj_step`, real-time with a budget per frame (a heavy model runs in slow motion and says so); play/pause `Space`, single step `→`, reset `⌫`, speed `−`/`=` (4× … 1/16×), keyframes from the model, real-time factor and sim time in the HUD |
| **Push it** | double-click a body to select it (highlighted, name and mass in a chip); `⌘`/`Ctrl`-drag pulls it with simulate's own spring (`mjv_applyPerturbForce`), `⇧` twists it; paused, the drag moves free bodies directly |
| **Controls** (`Tab`) | every actuator as a slider over its ctrlrange, writing `data.ctrl` live; "Take over" from the recording, Zero, controls from a keyframe; every joint's position, editable while paused |
| **Show** | contact points `C`, contact forces `F`, joint axes `J`, actuators `U`, tendons, centre of mass `M`, inertia boxes `I`, body/site/world frames `B`, sites, transparent `T`, wireframe `W`, shadows `H`, reflections `E`, skybox `K`, geom groups 0–5 — MuJoCo's own decorations from `mjv_updateScene`, sized and coloured by the model's `<visual>` |
| **Camera** | free orbit (drag, scroll, right-drag pan, `⌥`-double-click to look at a point), track the selected body, every `<camera>` in the model (`[` `]`), reset `0` |
| **Model / Sensors** | bodies as a tree with joints and masses, cameras, keyframes; sensors with live values; selecting a row selects the body |
| **Plot** | a live chart of the selected joint's position and velocity, an actuator's control and force, a body's height, energy, contacts, real-time factor or any sensor; in Replay, the whole recording with a cursor |
| **Replay** (`R`) | the recorded trajectory exactly, scrubbable on the same timeline; `←`/`→` frames; **Simulate from here** (`Enter`) hands that frame, velocities and controls to the physics |
| **Video** (`V`) | the rollout's mp4 on the same transport, when there is one |
| **Live** | a new rollout, an edited scene or a recompiled model reloads in place — camera, selection, panel kept; while the agent is recording, the header says so and the timeline fills in; a scene that does not compile yet keeps the last good model running and says why |
| **Model picker** | click the title: the agent's rollout, every MJCF in the workspace, every Menagerie robot |
| **What if…** | pin a full simulation state; compare 1–10 seconds with changed gravity, friction and a 0.15 s sideways force; overlay both futures, scrub their shared timeline, or click a separation measurement to inspect the greatest sampled difference or the final moment |
| **Keep an experiment** | download the exact compiled model inputs and assets, runtime patch, starting state, controls and measured frames as JSON, plus a measurements CSV; reproduce the JSON with the harness's native `toolchain/experiments.py` |

Light and dark follow the system; the panel docks beside the stage in a wide pane and floats over it
in a narrow one, with the picture shifted so the robot stays in view.

The What if lab uses two independent MuJoCo data instances and temporarily changes model options
inside each computation batch, restoring them before yielding. The live state stays intact. The
mint wireframe is the original world; the solid model is the changed one. Both use the same recorded
controls (holding the last row after the tape ends), or the actuator values captured at the start.
This is an open-loop comparison, not a new execution of the agent's Python controller. Measurement
paths follow the selected body's centre of mass, in metres. A shove acts in world +X or −X.
Click **Farthest apart** to pause at the first stored frame with the greatest measured separation;
**Apart at the finish** jumps to the final frame. The saved metrics include the maximum's frame
index and actual sample time. Both measurements describe stored frames, not a continuous-time search.

Agent saves wait while a comparison is active. Returning to simulation applies the pending update;
an invalid source edit keeps the previous model and its captured inputs. A new compiled model clears
the old lab state. Saved experiments carry their source assets, so they survive later workspace edits.

[Watch a native What if session](../../../docs/images/mujoco-what-if-demo.mp4): a Go2 receives a
100 N sideways force for 0.15 seconds while both worlds use the same recorded controls. The saved
three-second experiment reproduces with native MuJoCo independently of the original workspace.

## What the pane opens

The artifact Harness passes (`?file=`) is a hint, not the only way in. The server resolves
(`GET /api/resolve`), in order: a trajectory the artifact names or sits beside (a verdict that still
names `out/rollout.mp4` finds `out/rollout.qpos.json`), `out/rollout.qpos.json`, the report's
`model_path`, the model a script in `sim/` loads (`load_menagerie("unitree_go2")`, or a Menagerie
path spelled out in the script), the newest MJCF in `scenes/`. With nothing at all, a picker of the
Menagerie robots. `?model=menagerie/unitree_g1/scene.xml` opens a model by name.

## The rollout format

The [MuJoCo harness](../../agents/mujoco)'s `record()` writes it; anything that can write JSON can.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 2, "status": "done",               // "recording" while it is being written
  "model": "menagerie/unitree_go2/scene.xml",   // menagerie/… is the harness's; anything else is workspace-relative
  "model_xml": "out/rollout.model.xml",         // optional: the compiled model (MjSpec edits), loaded in place of
                                                //   `model` from `model`'s directory so its assets resolve
  "model_patch": { "opt.timestep": 0.001 },     // optional: runtime edits applied after compiling
  "dt": 0.034, "seconds": 5, "frames_expected": 151, "track": "base", "video": "out/rollout.mp4",
  "time": [0, 0.034, …],
  "qpos": [[…], …],                             // one row per frame — the only required field besides `model`
  "qvel": [[…], …],                             // optional: exact velocities for Simulate from here
  "ctrl": [[…], …],                             // optional: what the live simulation replays, interpolated per step
  "act":  [[…], …]                              // optional: actuator activations
}
```

Without `ctrl` (an older rollout) the pane replays exactly and simulates from the model's keyframe
controls.

## How it works

`viewer.mjs` is a dependency-free Node server on the loopback port Harness hands it. It serves the
page (`public/`), MuJoCo's `mujoco.wasm` and three.js from this package's `node_modules` (never a
CDN — the pane works offline), the workspace as `/ws/…` and the harness's Menagerie as
`/menagerie/…`, both with Range support (WebKit will not play a video without it). `GET /api/files`
reads a model's MJCF — `<include>`, `meshdir`/`texturedir`, every `file=` — and lists exactly the
files it needs; `GET /api/events` streams the workspace paths that change.

In the page, MuJoCo gets an in-memory filesystem and those files at their own relative paths, then
`mj_loadXML`. `engine.js` wraps the model and data: names from the names buffer (the bindings'
`mj_id2name` returns junk for unnamed objects), perturbation through `MjvPerturb`, picking through
`mj_ray`. `scene.js` builds three.js geometry from the compiled model (`mesh_vert`/`mesh_face`,
`geom_size`, `tex_data`), takes lights and per-geom texture flags from one `mjv_updateScene` pass,
decorations from `mjv_updateScene` every frame they are on, and colours with no sRGB transform and
Phong shading, as MuJoCo's renderer does; the skybox's face mapping was measured against MuJoCo's
own renderer. `main.js` runs the loop: physics on the main thread with a 9 ms budget per frame (the
Menagerie robots step 20–70× faster than real time in WASM), replay, the chrome. MuJoCo is Z-up and
so is the scene.

```bash
npm run smoke     # what setup.sh runs at install: the WASM API the pane depends on, and the server
npm test          # that, plus every route, start-up variant and script (test/*.test.mjs), on scratch workspaces
./doctor.sh       # what is installed
HARNESS_VIEWER_PORT=18997 HARNESS_WORKSPACE=/path/to/workspace \
  HARNESS_DSH_DIR=/path/to/autonomous-mujoco ./viewer.sh
```

`window.__mujocoViewer` exposes the engine, stage and state for tests.

The real-browser comparison suite additionally checks controls, downloads, deferred agent saves,
cancellation and the 390px layout:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=/absolute/path/to/playwright-core/index.mjs node test/experiments.browser.mjs
```

`BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` selects Chrome/Chromium and `EXPERIMENT_OUTPUT` selects the evidence folder.
`test/robot-experiments.browser.mjs` is an additional opt-in check on a real recorded Menagerie
robot. Set `EXPERIMENT_WORKSPACE` to a scratch rollout, `EXPERIMENT_MENAGERIE` to the pinned robots,
and `MUJOCO_PYTHON` to the harness's Python. It checks the compiled model, bundled assets and control
tape by independently reproducing the exported experiment with native MuJoCo.
The native reproduction command accepts `--model` to intentionally test a different model against
an experiment; the report records disagreement rather than overwriting the original measurements.

### What it does not draw

Height fields are drawn; flex bodies, skins and SDF geoms are not. Labels (`mjGEOM_LABEL`) are not
drawn. Collision geometry (group 3+) is hidden by default, as in `simulate`, and one toggle away.
