# Changes to the DSH contract

Append-only. Each entry: Change / Why / Backward compatible / Mechanism.

## 2026-09-14 — spec 1

Initial contract. Lifted from the `.board.json` (Circuit) and `.episode.json` (TV) sidecars and the Vibe viewer's `serve:ensure` handoff.

## 2026-09-15 — phases in the verdict
- **Change:** `verdict.phases` (optional, ≤ 12): `[{ id, name, state, artifact? }]` with
  `state ∈ done | active | pending | failed`. The daemon forwards it on `AgentFrame.verdict.phases`;
  the desktop draws a phase strip in the viewer pane's header beside the verdict chip.
- **Why:** the pane is progressive — a Workshop run is research, concept, 3D, verify, and the user
  watching the viewer needs to know which of those is happening. The verdict already moves; this
  is the one line that says where.
- **Backward compatible:** yes — absent means no strip; every existing verdict is unchanged.

## 2026-09-15 — `category`, and the first-party names
- **Change:** manifest and registry entries gain `category` (≤ 24 chars): what the harness makes,
  in a word or two — "PCB", "3D design", "Slides". `dsh_list` forwards it; the picker shows it under
  the name, the way every engine now shows "Code". The first-party ids are `autonomous/copper`
  (Circuit's pipeline) and `autonomous/solid` (Workshop's Make stage); `autonomous/marp` is unchanged.
- **Backward compatible:** `category` is optional. Manifests may list the ids they went by in
  `formerly` (≤ 8); the daemon resolves an agent's `HARNESS_DSH` through it, so an agent created as
  `autonomous/circuit` or `autonomous/workshop` keeps its harness, viewer and verdict after the
  rename. Without it, such an agent draws by its name and runs as its plain engine.

## 2026-09-16 — spec 1.1: viewer packages and `viewer.use`
- **Change:** a package declares its `kind`: `agent` (default; a harness, a tile) or `viewer` (a
  pane other packages point at; no `engine`, never a tile, ships `viewer.command` + `viewer.url`).
  A harness may declare `"viewer": { "use": "<viewer id>" }` instead of its own viewer, optionally
  narrowing `url` and `artifactExtensions`. The daemon installs the used viewer with the harness
  (from the registry), runs its command in the viewer's own directory with `HARNESS_VIEWER` and
  `HARNESS_VIEWER_DIR` added to the usual env, and publishes the URL exactly as for an own viewer.
  Registry entries carry `kind` too; `dsh_list` rows forward it so the picker skips viewers.
- **Why:** one viewer, many agents. Solid's 3D pane is a vendored copy of text-to-cad's CAD Viewer;
  text-to-cad itself, and any CAD agent after it, wants the same pane. A viewer that is its own
  package is installed once, credited once, and updated with a version bump instead of a re-vendor.
- **Backward compatible:** yes — `kind` absent is an agent, `viewer` with `command` is unchanged,
  every existing manifest and registry entry parses as before.
- **Mechanism:** `cli/src/dsh/manifest.ts` (`kind`, viewer union, `viewerUse`), `viewer.ts`
  (`resolveViewer`), `install.ts` (dependency install), `check.ts`, `backendSocket.ts` (`kind` on
  rows; a viewer package refused as an agent on create).

## 2026-09-16 — Toymaker
- **Change:** the Make harness is `autonomous/toymaker`, "Toymaker", category "Toys" (was
  `autonomous/solid`, "Solid", "3D design"). `formerly` lists `autonomous/solid` and
  `autonomous/workshop`, so every agent created under either keeps its harness.
- **Why:** the public buys toys — kits of printed parts, printed fasteners, a mechanism — and the
  name should say what comes out, not the room it comes from.
- **Backward compatible:** yes, through `formerly`.

## 2026-09-16 — `author`, and CAD as one category
- **Change:** manifest and registry entries gain `author` (≤ 80 chars): who made the agent —
  "Autonomous" for Copper and Toymaker, "Jake Fitzgerald" for text-to-cad, "Yuki Hattori" for Marp, a vendor for a built-in engine. `dsh_list`
  forwards it; the picker shows it beside the category ("CAD · Autonomous"), and every built-in engine shows its maker the same way
  ("Code · OpenAI"). Toymaker and text-to-cad share the category "CAD".
- **Backward compatible:** `author` is optional.

## 2026-09-16 — The Harness Store
- **Change:** registry entries gain the facts a store page needs, all optional: `homepage` (the
  project's site), `upstream` (the repo a wrapper brings into Harness), `license` (SPDX id of the
  wrapper), `screenshots` (https URLs, ≤ 8). `dsh_list` rows carry them — plus `repo`, and `linked`
  for an install that is a link to a checkout — whether or not the package is installed, because a
  manifest does not know them. A new RPC, `dsh_remove { id }`, uninstalls a package from the machine
  that answers it (a linked install loses only its link) and replies `{ ok, id }` or
  `{ error, detail }`; a daemon without it answers `UNSUPPORTED`, which the app turns into "update the
  CLI". Ratings and reviews live in the control plane (`/api/store/…`), proxied by the local CLI
  like the machine list; they are keyed by registry id and are not part of the package.
- **Why:** the app's Harness Store shows every registry package as a card and a page — whose it is,
  where it lives, what it is licensed under, what people think, and where it is installed — and a
  page with Get needs a Remove.
- **Backward compatible:** yes — every field is optional, every old row and manifest parses as before.
- **Mechanism:** `cli/src/dsh/registry.ts`, `backendSocket.ts` (`dsh_list` facts, `dsh_remove`),
  `hookServer.ts` (`/api/store/*` proxy), `backend/src/routes/store.ts`, `desktop/lib/store/`.

## 2026-09-16 — Skills a setup fetches
- **Change:** `harness dsh check` warns instead of failing when an `agent.skills` root is missing
  from the checkout but the manifest declares `toolchain.setup`. The root must exist after setup, or
  the agent gets no skills.
- **Why:** a project that publishes skills without a licence to copy them (Remotion's, for one) can
  still be wrapped — its skills are fetched at install time, at a pinned commit, never vendored.

## 2026-09-17 — Autonomous Circuit and Autonomous Workshop
- **Change:** the harnesses known as Copper (`autonomous/copper`) and Toymaker (`autonomous/toymaker`)
  are `autonomous/autonomous-circuit`, "Autonomous Circuit", and `autonomous/autonomous-workshop`,
  "Autonomous Workshop" (category "CAD"). Their `formerly` lists carry every id either answered to
  (`copper`, `circuit`; `toymaker`, `solid`, `workshop`).
- **Why:** both are other Autonomous teams' projects. The store treats them like any upstream it
  wraps — under the project's own name, fetched read-only from its own repository — rather than
  renaming them.
- **Backward compatible:** yes, through `formerly`.

## 2026-09-17 — A package may be one folder of a repository; the built-in shelf
- **Change:** a registry entry may name `path`, a relative folder inside `repo` that is the package.
  Install makes a blob-less, sparse clone of `repo` at `ref`, keeps that folder alone and lays it out
  exactly like a whole-repo install (the manifest at the install root, no `.git`); `installed.json`
  records `path`. `harness dsh install <url> --path <folder>` does the same by hand, and a
  `viewer.use` dependency resolves through its own entry's `path`. `dsh_list`'s `repo` for such an
  entry is the folder's browsable URL. The packages Autonomous maintains live in the Harness
  monorepo at `store/agents/<name>` and `store/viewers/<name>`, with `kind` matching the folder and
  the id `autonomous/<name>`; `cli/src/dsh/store.spec.ts` holds folders and registry to each other.
  `HARNESS_STORE_REF` makes the daemon install the built-in shelf from another ref, to try a store
  branch before it merges.
- **Also:** `harness dsh check` warns instead of failing when `agent.instructions` or
  `workspace.template` is missing but `toolchain.setup` is declared — the shape of a wrapper whose
  setup fetches its upstream — as it already did for skills.
- **Why:** one repository for the shelf keeps a CLI change and the packages that need it in one
  review, and a package that grows up can still leave for a repository of its own.
- **Backward compatible:** yes — `path` is optional, and a record without it is a whole-repo install.
- **Mechanism:** `cli/src/dsh/install.ts` (`cloneInstall`), `registry.ts` (`path`,
  `registrySourceUrl`, `HARNESS_STORE_REF`), `command.ts` (`--path`), `check.ts`, `store/README.md`.

## 2026-09-17 — One store folder; a built-in package is its own registry entry
- **Change:** everything under `dsh/` moved into `store/`: the spec (`store/spec`), the starter
  (`store/starter`), the tools (`store/tools`), the guide (`store/README.md`) and the listing for packages
  that live elsewhere (`store/registry/<owner>/<name>.json`). A built-in package no longer has a
  registry file: the CLI build turns each `store/<agents|viewers>/<name>` folder into its entry —
  name, kind, category, author, description and engine from `harness.json`; `homepage`, `upstream`,
  `license` and `screenshots` from a new `store.json` beside it (`StoreFactsSchema`); repo this
  repository, ref `main`, path the folder, tier from what the manifest ships, `verified: true`. An
  outside entry whose id a built-in folder already has is dropped.
- **Why:** each fact is written once, adding a built-in package is adding a folder, and the contract,
  the packages and the listing are one place instead of two.
- **Backward compatible:** yes — the bundled registry has the same shape and entries as before.
- **Unchanged on purpose:** `harness dsh …`, `dsh_list`/`dsh_install`/`dsh_remove`, `cli/src/dsh/` and
  `~/.harness/dsh` keep the DSH name; they are the CLI's public contract.
- **Mechanism:** `cli/src/dsh/registry.ts` (`storeEntry`, `readStoreDir`, `StoreFactsSchema`),
  `cli/scripts/lib/dshRegistry.mjs`, `cli/src/dsh/store.spec.ts`.

## 2026-09-16 — shared viewer dependency information in the catalog

- **Change:** registry entries may include `viewerUse`, a viewer package ID. Built-in entries derive
  it from `harness.json`'s `viewer.use`. `dsh_list` forwards it for installed packages from the actual
  manifest, and for available packages from the registry; no shared dependency is reported as null.
- **Why:** the Store's Viewers inventory can show which agents use each viewer, including community
  packages and packages that are not installed yet.
- **Backward compatible:** yes. The field is optional; existing manifests and entries are unchanged,
  and clients accept catalogs from older daemons without dependency information.
- **Mechanism:** the registry builder and runtime reader, `backendSocket.ts`, and the desktop
  `DshEntry` model. Viewer install, sharing, and launch behavior are unchanged.

## 2026-09-17 — `examples` on the store page

- **Change:** registry entries and `store.json` may include `examples` (≤ 8):
  `[{ prompt, image?, caption? }]` — a prompt (≤ 600 chars), an https picture of what the harness made
  from it, and a line naming the result (≤ 120). `dsh_list` forwards them like `screenshots`; the
  product page leads with them, and "Try this prompt" opens New Harness with the prompt as its first
  message.
- **Why:** a list of features says what a harness is; a prompt beside its real output shows what it
  does, which is what makes someone try it.
- **Backward compatible:** yes. The field is optional; an app that predates it ignores it, and a page
  without examples keeps its editorial prompt list. A daemon that predates it forwards none.
- **Mechanism:** `StoreExampleSchema` in `cli/src/dsh/registry.ts`, `cli/scripts/lib/dshRegistry.mjs`,
  `cli/src/dsh/wire.ts`, the publisher's checks in `store/tools/catalog.mjs`, and the desktop
  `StoreExample` / `StoreShowcase`.

## 2026-09-17 — `tagline` for choosing a harness

- **Change:** registry entries and `store.json` may include `tagline` (≤ 80 characters): one line in the
  project's own words, from its website or repository. `dsh_list` forwards it like `license`. New
  Harness's agent search shows it under the name, with the author beside the name.
- **Why:** a category like "Chips" or "Simulation" says little on its own; the project's own line says
  what the harness does.
- **Backward compatible:** yes. The field is optional; an app that predates it ignores it, and a
  package without one shows its category. A daemon that predates it forwards none, and the app falls back
  to its own words for the built-in harnesses.
- **Mechanism:** `DshRegistryEntrySchema` and `StoreFactsSchema` in `cli/src/dsh/registry.ts`,
  `cli/scripts/lib/dshRegistry.mjs`, `cli/src/dsh/wire.ts`, the publisher's limits in
  `store/tools/catalog.mjs`, and the desktop `DshEntry.tagline` and `EngineIdentity.tagline`.

## 2026-09-17 — explicit package updates

- **Change:** installed records add optional `revision` (the package Git tree) and `updatedAt`.
  Catalog entries add optional `revision`; `ref` remains the source commit or ref to fetch.
  Installed `dsh_list` rows add `installedCommit`, `availableCommit` (nullable source SHAs) and
  `updateAvailable`. A changed tree avoids false updates from unrelated monorepo commits; older
  records fall back to comparing source commits. Linked installs and different sources are excluded.
- **Wire:** `dsh_update { id }` replies `{ ok: true, id }` or `{ error, detail }`, reusing
  `dsh_install_status` for clone/setup/doctor/done/failed progress. The daemon validates the id and
  follows the stored source; request URL/ref overrides are not accepted. Concurrent package mutations
  return `DSH_BUSY`. Unsupported daemons retain their normal unsupported-request response.
- **Behavior:** `harness dsh update <id>` and the Store's Update action replace the package only after
  fetching and identity checks. Setup and doctor run at its permanent path, with the previous copy
  retained until success. On failure it is restored; workspaces are never rematerialized by an update.
  Setup scripts' changes outside the package cannot be reverted by the host.
- **Backward compatible:** all version fields are optional additions. Older records remain readable;
  older desktop clients ignore new fields, and newer clients show their existing actions for daemons
  without update metadata. Shared viewers update independently.
