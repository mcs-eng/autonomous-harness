# Jev Firehose

**Thousands of made-up inbox messages stream in. Jev triages every one in a single call.**

Jev is TypeSafe AI's System One model. It does not write text. You send it a state and a set of
typed questions, and it answers all of them in one pass, each with probabilities. Jev Firehose
shows what that is good for: sorting a lot of small things, fast and cheap.

A seeded generator writes synthetic messages for a support inbox. Each message has a known true
team, so the pane can measure accuracy as it goes. For every message Jev answers five questions in
one call:

| question | type | what it asks |
|---|---|---|
| `team` | choice | which team should own this message |
| `urgency` | score, 5 levels | how fast the sender wants an answer |
| `spam` | noul | is this spam |
| `needs_human` | noul | should a person take over |
| `mood` | score, 3 levels | calm, annoyed or furious |

If Jev's `team` confidence is under the `threshold`, the message is not auto-routed. It drops into
an amber "escalate to a big model" lane. The pane shows how many were auto-routed, how many of those
were right, and how many were escalated.

This is a harness for OpenHarness. The agent on the right edits `firehose.json`. The viewer on the
left watches that file and reacts live.

**Out of the box all data is made up.** The shop, the teams and every message are synthetic. It is a
demo of speed, cost and calibration, not a real support system. You can also point it at a file of
your own messages (see "Bring your own messages").

## The pane

- **Main scene.** Messages spray from the nozzle as small tiles, coloured by their true team. They
  cross the Jev gate at the height of Jev's confidence, then arc into team bins that fill up. A red
  ring marks a wrong bin. Tiles under the threshold drop into the amber lane.
- **Top bar.** Messages done, messages per second, cost so far, accuracy of auto-routed messages,
  share escalated, elapsed time.
- **The race.** Jev's progress bar, and under it a ghost bar: "a model taking 2s per message would
  be on message N". The 2 seconds is an assumption you can change (`llmSecondsPerItem`).
- **Rail.** Jev's live mind (questions and probability bars), an inspector, a short "how it works",
  and a confusion matrix (true team by routed bin).

Things to try in the pane:

1. Drag the **threshold** slider, or drag the amber line on the gate. Messages that were already
   routed move between the bins and the escalate lane at once.
2. Drag the **noise** slider. New messages get more phrases from a wrong team mixed in.
3. Click a **bin** or a **tile**. The inspector shows the message text, every answer with its
   probabilities, the true team, and right or wrong.
4. Press **Burst +500**.
5. **Pause**, **Step**, **Reset**.

Slider changes are runtime overrides. An edit to `firehose.json` resets them.

When a batch is done the pane shows a summary card for about three seconds, for example
`2,000 messages · 50.0s · $0.0445 · 97.3% right · 10.1% escalated`, then starts the next batch with a
new seed. It never stops.

## Bring your own messages

Put a file of your own messages in the workspace and point `firehose.json` at it:

```json
{ "source": "inbox.jsonl", "textColumn": "body", "threshold": 0.55, "teams": [ { "id": "billing", "description": "Payment: card charged, invoice, refund." } ] }
```

`.csv`, `.tsv`, `.jsonl` and `.json` work, up to 8 MB and 20,000 messages. The file must be inside
the workspace. Then the generator is off and the pane says "your data". The same five questions run
on every message, once through the file. There is no answer key, so accuracy, the red rings and the
confusion matrix are gone. You get a confidence histogram, the share escalated, a count per team,
and the most and least confident message of each team in the inspector.

The results land in `triage.csv` next to your file, one line per message: `id`, `team`,
`team_confidence`, `urgency`, `spam`, `needs_human`, `mood`, `escalated`, then your own columns as
they were. It is rewritten about once a second while it runs, once at the end, and again when you
move the threshold. When the file is done the summary card stays, with a **Run again** button.

With a key, only the text column is sent to the Jev API, one message per call. Your other columns
never leave the machine. Without a key nothing leaves the machine, and the offline stand-in's word
matching gives only a rough triage.

What it costs: the five questions and your team descriptions are sent with every call, so a call is
about 530 input tokens on the starter desk (about 450 of them are the questions). At $0.042 per
million input tokens that is about 11 cents for 5,000 messages. Shorter team descriptions make it
cheaper. The pane shows the real number as it runs.

## The honest dial

`noise` (0 to 1) sets how many phrases from one wrong team are mixed into each message. It is capped
so a message never has more wrong-team phrases than true ones. At low noise the true team is clear.
At high noise every message is an even split, so any reader, model or person, has to guess.

Measured on the starter desk with the offline stand-in, threshold 0.55, 400 messages each:

| noise | auto-routed right | escalated |
|---|---|---|
| 0.05 | 99.5% | 2.5% |
| 0.85 | 58.4% | 24.3% |

Nothing random is injected into Jev's answers. The messages themselves get harder.

## Jev, honestly

With `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` set, every message is one real call to `POST /v1/systemone`. Without a key
the harness runs on a deterministic offline stand-in that scores shared words between the message
and each option's description. The stand-in is there so the plumbing, the pane and the tests work
offline. It is **not** Jev's judgement, and the pane badges it `MOCK`. The cost shown is what live
Jev would charge for the same tokens ($0.042 per million input tokens, output free).

The "2s per message" comparison is an assumption drawn as a ghost bar, not a measurement of any
model.

## Measured with the real model

One short run on 2026-09-20 with live Jev (`typesafe/jev-1.13`) through OpenRouter, about 0.45 s a call once warm. Small samples on made-up data: a sanity check, not a benchmark.

300 made-up messages at noise 0.2 and threshold 0.55: 25.4 s, $0.0107, 98.0% of auto-routed messages
right, 1.0% escalated. That is five questions a message, about 12 messages a second with a pool of 8.
