# Jev Browser

**Point it at a web page. Get a spreadsheet.** Type an address, say what one "thing" on it is, and
list the columns you want. A real Chrome opens, walks the site, and writes `results.csv` while you
watch. No code, no selectors, no copy and paste.

## How you use it

A site and a sentence is the whole job.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Start on** | `books.toscrape.com` |
| **What you want** | `travel books, with the price and whether they are in stock` |

Press **Go**. Jev walks the site to the page you meant, reads it, works out the columns, and
starts collecting. There is nothing else to press.

**It finds its own way.** The address does not have to be the list you want. Each step is one Jev
call: does this page already show what was asked for, and if not, which link goes towards it? On
that example it scores the "Travel" link at 0.97 out of the 62 links on the front page, follows it,
and works from there. Give it the exact page if you have it and it starts there instead.

**Jev picks the columns, it does not write them.** It is shown every piece of text on one of the
pages and asked, for each, whether that is a fact about this thing worth a column. The column's
name comes from the page's own label where there is one, so a spreadsheet of books comes out with
Price, Availability, UPC and Number of reviews on it. Your sentence is never parsed into a config;
it is given to Jev as context while it decides what matters.

Name the columns yourself if you would rather: put them in the **Columns** box, one per line. A
line that reads like a question ("Is it in stock?") becomes a yes-or-no column, and everything else
is taken off the page word for word.

The agent on the right is for the rest: a site that fights back, a column that comes back empty,
and reading what you collected. You do not need it to run a job. Ask it in plain words and it
writes the same job file the form does, and that starts on its own too.

**Every value is text taken off the page.** Jev, TypeSafe's System One model, never writes words. It
is shown the numbered pieces of text that really are on the page and it picks one. So a cell holds
the page's own words, or it holds nothing. A made-up price is not possible, because there is nothing
to make one out of.

This is a harness for OpenHarness. The pane on the left is the browser and the spreadsheet. The
agent on the right writes the job with you, reads the results, and sharpens what came back thin.

## One call per page

That single call to Jev holds everything worth asking about the page.

- **On a list page**: what kind of page it is, **one yes-or-no for every link on it**, and which
  link is the next page. 120 links is 122 typed questions, answered together, each with its own
  probability. In the picture above, the twelve real roles came back at 76 to 88 per cent and the
  menu links at 2 per cent.
- **On one thing's page**: every field at once, each a choice over the page's own text.

Many questions about one page cost about the same as one, so this is the cheap way round.

## What it will not do

The refusals sit next to the only code that can touch a page, so nothing above them can go around.

- **It only reads.** It never submits a form, and never presses anything that reads like pay, buy,
  checkout, delete, send, apply or book.
- **It never types a password, a card number or a one-time code.** If a site needs a login, you sign
  in yourself in the window. The profile is kept in your project folder, so the next run is already
  signed in.
- **It stays on the sites your job names**, on http and https only, and downloads are refused.
- **A search box is the one control it will ever use**, because searching asks a site a question
  rather than buying, sending or deleting anything.

Some sites say in their terms that they do not want to be read this way, and some sell an API for
the same data. That is your call to make, and the harness will not go around a block or a login.

## Try it in ten seconds

Press **Try the practice site**. The harness serves its own small job board on your machine, with
real HTTP, real links, real pagination and a real browser. Only the content of that site is made
up. It even has a search box, so you can try the "search for" line on it.

## The job, which is also the recipe

```jsonc
{
  "task": "Every flat for rent in the search results, with rent and address",
  "start": "https://example.com/search?area=leeds",
  "item": "a flat for rent",
  "fields": [
    { "id": "address", "name": "Address", "ask": "the street address" },
    { "id": "rent", "name": "Rent", "ask": "the monthly rent" },
    { "id": "garden", "name": "Garden?", "ask": "Does it have a garden?", "type": "yesno" }
  ],
  "maxItems": 60,
  "maxPages": 25
}
```

Run it again next month and you get next month's answer. That file is the whole recipe. Saving it
starts a run, so the agent writing it for you has the same effect as pressing Go. Set
`"autoStart": false` if you would rather press the button yourself.

## What you get

- **`results.csv`** in your project folder: one row per thing, every column with the confidence Jev
  had in it, and the address of the page it came off. Every number in your spreadsheet can be
  checked against the page that produced it. Download it from the pane or open it from the folder.
- The agent on the right will count it, tell you what is missing, and sharpen the weak columns.

## Measured

On 2026-09-20 with live Jev (`typesafe/jev-1.13`) through OpenRouter.

| Run | Things | Time | Cost | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The built-in job board, 36 roles | 24 | 33 s | $0.0023 | 144 of 144 cells exactly matched the site's own data, no repeats, nothing skipped |
| `books.toscrape.com`, a public sandbox | 8 | 21 s | $0.0018 | every title, price, stock count and UPC code right |

Working out the job from scratch, on the same site: two Jev calls, 61 questions then 33, **1.2
seconds** to decide the page lists products and to propose columns named Price, Availability, UPC
and Number of reviews. No language model is involved at any point, in setting the job up or in
running it.

The product codes matter: `a22124811bfa8350` is not something a model could write from memory. It
came off the page, which is the whole point. Small runs are a sanity check, not a benchmark.

## Without a key

The pane runs on an offline stand-in that matches words. It shows the plumbing and it is honest
about being a stand-in, but its rows are not worth acting on. Paste an OpenRouter or TypeSafe key
into the **Jev · live mind** panel in the pane. It is saved on your machine in
`~/.config/typesafe/credentials` and checked with one tiny call.

## When the pane does nothing

One command runs the whole chain — Chrome, a page, the reader, one Jev call — and prints `ok` or
`FAIL` for each link, so you find out which one broke instead of guessing:

```
bash toolchain/doctor.sh                  the built-in site, about five seconds
bash toolchain/doctor.sh https://…        that site instead
bash toolchain/doctor.sh --show           a visible window, the way the pane runs it
```

The three that actually happen:

- **out of credit.** Every call comes back 402 and nothing can be answered. Top the account up
  with your provider. The pane says so in as many words now.
- **a browser left open.** Chrome will not open a second window on this harness's profile; it
  hands the request to the open one and quits. Close that window and press Go again.
- **the site says no.** Some sites serve a challenge page to any automated browser. It is named in
  the pane rather than collected from. Try another site.

## Which sites let it read

Checked on 2026-09-20, one page each, with the headless browser the tests use.

| Reads | Blocks |
|---|---|
| news.ycombinator.com, arxiv.org, gov.uk, data.gov.uk, github.com, weworkremotely.com, shop.bbc.com, books.toscrape.com | amazon.com, en.wikipedia.org, rightmove.co.uk, and three fencing retailers (absolutefencinggear.com, blue-gauntlet.com, leonpaul.com) |

The pattern is not "big versus small". It is whether the site runs bot protection. Cloudflare's
"Just a moment…", Amazon's "Sorry! Something went wrong", Rightmove's "Client Challenge" and
Wikipedia's robot-policy page are all the same answer: no. Plenty of small specialist shops sit
behind Cloudflare, and a large shop like shop.bbc.com does not.

Public, reference, government, open-data, code, papers, forums and job boards mostly read. Consumer
retail and property mostly do not. There is no way to know but to try, which takes about ten
seconds: point it at the page and the pane tells you straight away.

When a site says no, that is the end of it. The harness names the site and stops. It will not
change what it looks like to get past a challenge, and neither should the agent. Where a site sells
an API for the same data, that is the route they want you to use.

## The honest limit

The limit is the page, not the model. A site that prints its values as text reads perfectly. A site
that draws them as pictures, hides them behind a click, or loads them on scroll gives blank cells.
Those show up as an empty column that the verdict marks thin, not as a wrong answer. The tool would
rather leave a cell empty than write something the page never said.

## Requirements

Google Chrome on the machine, and Node 22 or newer. `toolchain/doctor.sh` says whether both are
there. Set `CHROME_PATH` if Chrome lives somewhere unusual.

## Credit and stewardship

- **Jev** is the work of **TypeSafe AI** (typesafe.ai). This harness is an OpenHarness wrapper that
  only calls the public API. It contains no TypeSafe code.
- The idea of a decision model picking the next browser action out of the page's own elements comes
  from the open-source browser agents the community built around Jev. This harness is an
  independent, from-scratch tool and uses none of their code.
- **Google Chrome** is Google's, and is not included: the harness drives whatever Chrome you have.
- **OpenHarness** (Autonomous) is MIT-licensed. This wrapper is MIT too (see `LICENSE`).
- Built by Autonomous for the OpenHarness store.
