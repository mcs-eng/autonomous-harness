/**
 * The rules, as data and as one pure function.
 *
 * Everything about what *should* happen to a fleet lives here: no tmux, no sockets, no clock of its
 * own. `decide()` takes rows and a policy and returns a plan — one entry per row, with the rule that
 * chose it and a sentence saying why. The CLI prints that plan, the viewer draws it, `hps prune --apply`
 * executes it, and the tests assert on it. A rule nobody can simulate is a rule nobody should run,
 * which is the whole reason this file has no side effects.
 *
 * The vocabulary, kept identical everywhere:
 *   running    the engine process is alive — a normal Harness agent
 *   paused   the pane and the conversation are there, the engine process is not (the daemon's own
 *            "dormant but still viewable agent"); resuming it resumes the conversation
 *   gone     no pane left; the daemon dropped the row. History only, nothing to resume
