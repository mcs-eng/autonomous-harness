/**
 * One row per harness, from every source that knows something about it.
 *
 * The daemon knows who the agents are, where their panes are and when their transcripts last moved.
 * tmux knows whether a pane is alive, dead or attached. The process table knows what the engine is
 * holding. This package's own state file knows what a person decided (pinned, paused). This module is
 * where those four become the single row shape that the policy, the table and the hps all read, and
 * it is the only place that decides what `state` means.
 *
 * Every machine's agents are listed — the local bridge relays `machine_select` to any machine the user
 * has linked — but pane and memory facts, and every action, are local to this computer. A remote row is
 * marked `local: false` and reads as what it is: seen, not managed from here.

 *   the pane is gone from tmux             → gone      (nothing to resume; history only)
 *   the pane is there and an engine is up   → running
 *   the pane is there, no engine, a ticket  → paused    (conversation intact, waiting to be resumed)
 *   the pane is there, no engine, no ticket → terminal  (a shell somebody opened; nothing to pause)
 * and that is the whole state machine. There is deliberately no fourth state: an earlier version had
 * `retired` as paused-plus-a-decision, and every consumer paid for it — a glyph, a filter, a verb, a
 * grace window — to express something a sorted list already expresses.
 *
 * ## Why a paused row needs the ticket to describe itself
 *
 * When an engine leaves, the daemon does not merely mark the row: it REWRITES it as a terminal. Measured
 * on a real pause, the row kept its `cwd` and lost everything else — `engine` became `terminal`,
 * `sessionId` became empty, `transcriptPath` and `title` became null. So a paused harness would appear in
 * Harness Monitor's own list as a nameless shell, and nothing would know which conversation to resume. The ticket
 * `pause()` wrote into `monitor.json` is the only record, and it is overlaid here.
