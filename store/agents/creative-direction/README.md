# Creative Direction — Forme

> Withdrawn from Store discovery on 2026-09-20: the current starter does not meet our
> standard for an open-ended tool that completes real user work. Existing projects and
> source remain available. See [the product review](../../../work/SUPERPOWERS.md).

Build a coherent visual identity with coordinated posters, typography and palettes. Compare art directions, lock colors, customize a name, and export SVG posters and design tokens.

## Try it

> Create a coastal identity for COVE STUDIO: mineral green, warm paper, an expressive serif, and a poster that feels like a place to stay.

The starter already works before the first prompt. Change it with the agent, interact with the
result in the pane, and keep the output. Everything needed at runtime is in `board/index.html`.
It works offline and can be opened outside Harness.

## What you can do

Three complete art directions, live brand name, palette lock, computed text contrast, SVG poster export, JSON design tokens.

## Build on the starter

The model functions `directionModel`, `contrast` and `brandSVG` are the starting points for substantive changes. Preserve seed
reproducibility and user controls while changing the domain behavior. A different brief can replace
this starter's entire visual language. Keep the artifact self-contained and test the actual result.

The source checkout builds these starters with `node store/tools/build-experiences.mjs`. Installed
workspaces are editable HTML; no build tool, network dependency or paid service is required.

## Verification

Model census: `node --test store/tools/experience-tests/models.test.mjs` from the source checkout.
Browser interactions, exports, same-origin APIs and manifest routing: see
[`store/tools/experience-tests`](../../tools/experience-tests/README.md).

`seed-verdict.sh` establishes only artifact presence and keeps `ready:false`. The agent must run
and record real domain and browser checks before writing a ready verdict. No cross-device pixel or
audio equality is promised. The research is inspiration; this is original code, not a wrapper of
any cited third-party engine.

## Check your actual edited model

Run `node tools/check.mjs --seeds 100` in the workspace. It reads the pure model from
`<script id="harness-model">` in the artifact, checks domain invariants, repeats each seed, and
writes `.harness/model-check.json`. Preserve that script boundary when editing. Model checks are
followed by browser interaction, exported-output inspection, and visual or listening review.

## Logo and icon

The original identity ships in `brand/`: [vector icon](brand/icon.svg),
[256px PNG](brand/icon.png), [light logo](brand/logo.svg) and
[dark logo](brand/logo-dark.svg). The same mark appears in the starter header,
its offline favicon and the desktop Store/picker/tabs. MIT, by OpenHarness contributors.
