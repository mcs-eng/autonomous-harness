#   waves      vcd2json.py      out/sim.vcd               -> out/waves.json

#   schematic  yosys prep                                 -> out/<top>_schematic.json
#   svg        netlistsvg                                 -> out/<top>.svg       (the drawing)
#   pnr        nextpnr-ice40                              -> out/<top>.asc, out/<top>_pnr.json,

#
# Beside every step's log, out/logs/ gets <step>.start (epoch ms, written before the step runs),
# <step>.time ("start end", epoch ms) and <step>.exit, and out/logs/run.json says which run this is
# and whether it has finished. The pane reads those to draw the pipeline live: which step is
# running right now, for how long, and which ones this run skipped.
#
# `set -e` is deliberately NOT on: a step that fails must still leave the ones before it standing,
# and the verdict — not this script's exit code — is how failure reaches the user. The verdict is
# rewritten after EVERY step, so the pane fills in as the flow runs instead of jumping at the end.
#
# Environment (all optional):
#   YOSYS_TOP        the top module; the argument wins over this
#   YOSYS_DEVICE     nextpnr device flag, default --up5k
#   YOSYS_PACKAGE    nextpnr package, default sg48
#   YOSYS_TOOLCHAIN  this directory; set by the harness
#   HARNESS_DSH_DIR  the install dir (netlistsvg lives in its node_modules)
#
# The tools come from path.sh: the package's own OSS CAD Suite when setup.sh fetched it, else the
# machine's (Homebrew's bin included), and node for netlistsvg even when PATH has none.
