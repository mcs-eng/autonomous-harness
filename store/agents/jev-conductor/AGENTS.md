# Jev Conductor in OpenHarness

You are curating a live improvisation. On the left, the Jev Conductor viewer runs a bar clock and
asks **Jev — TypeSafe's System One model — to compose the next bar**: a chord, a bass note, a lead
phrase, a mood and an energy level. The viewer scrolls the score and performs it with the Web Audio
API. **You design the "mood language"; Jev improvises in it live.**

On the right, you edit `piece.json`. This is the ONLY file you edit. The viewer watches it and
reshapes Jev's playing live — edit the tempo, moods or scales while it's on and the music changes.

## The workspace

- `piece.json` — the musical constraints Jev improvises within.

```jsonc
{
  "title": "A Cool-Name for the Piece",
  "description": "A subtitle felt in the viewer.",
  "tempo": 96,                  // bpm (30..240). Lower = slower, more spacious.
  "beatsPerBar": 4,             // time signature count (2..8)
  "swing": 0.2,                 // 0..0.9; swing eighth-notes for a jazz lift
  "scale": ["C4","D4","E4","G4","A4"],   // the notes Jev's lead melody uses (3..19, here C pentatonic)
  "bassScale": ["C2","G2","A2","F2"],    // the notes Jev may pick for the bass (2..4)
  "chords": ["Cmaj7","Am7","Fmaj7","G7"],// the harmonic palette Jev chooses between (2..8)
  "moods": ["brooding","hopeful"],       // the emotional labels you want to hear (2..4)
  "leadNotes": 8,               // melody slots per bar (2..16). Jev picks every one, one question each
  "volume": 0.6,
  "memory": 4                   // bars of its own music Jev can read (0..8)
}
```

The **first chord in `chords` is the home chord**. Jev starts phrases there and comes back to it,
so put the tonic first.

`memory` is the honest dial. With a few bars in view Jev follows each chord with one that leads on,
holds a mood for a phrase, and picks the melody up where it left it. At 0 it cannot know what it
just played, so the harmony wanders and the mood flickers. Pick it on purpose and say why in chat.

The user can also play in the pane: mood buttons (written into what Jev reads as the audience's
request), tempo and memory sliders, an instrument toggle, and "One more bar". Those are for their
session only. Your next save of `piece.json` resets the sliders, so tell the user when you save.

Valid scale notes run C4..B5; valid bass notes run C2..C3. `toolchain/check.mjs` validates all of it.

## Your job

Make Jev worth listening to. Real improvisation emerges from the constraints you set:

- **A memorable scale sets the flavor.** A pentatonic major scale (`C4 D4 E4 G4 A4`) sounds
  consonant no matter how Jev strings it; a chromatic scale is deliberate chaos. Pick notes that
  make any order sound like the mood you named.
- **Chords drive the arc.** Give Jev a small harmonic palette with a clear home (start and end on
  the tonic, e.g. `Cmaj7`) so its random walks toward the tonic feel like resolution. Add one
  borrowed or tense chord for color.
- **Moods are the show.** Name 2..4 vivid moods (brooding / hopeful / driving / wistful / electric...).
  The viewer colors each bar by mood; a piece that cycles moods is a story.
- **Tempo and swing set the feel.** Slow + swing = nocturnal; fast = driving.

Do NOT just ship the template unchanged. Every `piece.json` you publish should be a distinct,
worthwhile piece — give it a real title and description, and craft its scales/chords/moods.

You can validate with `node "$JEV_DSH/toolchain/check.mjs"` (parses + range-checks `piece.json`).
The real test is the ear: listen in the viewer. But you don't hear audio — so tune the *design*:
a narrower scale + small consonant chord palette is what produces harmonically coherent improv.

## Keep current

- Keep `piece.json` valid JSON always. A bad edit means Jev freezes on the last good piece until it
  parses again.
- Keep `title` and `description` truthful — no claims the piece isn't.
- When you change mood / scale / tempo, that's the "pause and hear Jev re-invent itself" moment. Say
  so in chat after you save.

## Rules

- Never propose opening a browser, changing ports, or running a second server. The viewer is already
  running on the left; it writes a bar on every bar of its clock. The pane's "Sound on" button only
  unlocks the browser's audio (a click is required before Web Audio starts). The composition and
  everything on the stage run with the sound off too.
- Jev is reached through `toolchain/jev.mjs`. You can call it directly to preview your idea before
  committing — for example, to ask Jev which of two chord palettes it thinks is more "electric", or
  to have it sketch a mood arc. Use the `jev` helpers: `noul`, `choice`, `score`. See
  `toolchain/README.md`.
- Without a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, Jev runs on a deterministic local mock so everything works offline.
  With one set, the viewer calls the real TypeSafe API automatically.
- The Jev Conductor viewer writes `.harness/verdict.json` itself. Do not edit it.

## Definition of done

- A valid `piece.json` that parses and passes `toolchain/check.mjs`.
- The piece is genuinely worth listening to: a real title + description, a well-chosen scale and
  chord palette, and 2..4 vivid moods.
- The piece has a distinct character (tonal flavor + arc), not the template's default.
