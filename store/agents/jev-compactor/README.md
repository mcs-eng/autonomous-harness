# Jev Compactor

**A live demo of one idea: context compaction does not have to be a summarization prompt.**
A made-up coding agent works in a made-up repo. Its context window fills with messages and tool
results. When the window passes its budget, Jev (TypeSafe's System One model) judges **every tool
result in one pass**: `keep`, `trim` or `drop`. The tower collapses, and the result is measured
against a hidden ground truth.

This is a demo on synthetic data. It is not a real compaction plugin, and it says nothing about
any real product. The session, the repo, the tool output and the token counts are all generated.

This is a harness for OpenHarness. The agent on the right edits `session.json`. The viewer on the
left runs the session and asks Jev to compact it, live.

## What you see

- **The context tower.** One block per event, newest on top, coloured by kind (user, assistant,
  Read, Grep, Bash, Edit, WebFetch). The height axis is curved so a small window is still easy to
  see, but the budget line is exact. A thin strip beside the tower shows the ground truth: green
  means "needed for the current task".
- **Compaction.** A scan line sweeps the tower. Each block flashes its verdict and probability.
  Dropped blocks dissolve, trimmed blocks shrink, the tower collapses and the big token counter
  rolls down.
- **The numbers.** Tokens now, budget, reduction, needle recall, compaction time, questions per
  call, results judged and cost so far.
- **The baseline lane.** A slim second tower runs "summarize instead": when over budget it folds
  the oldest half of its window into one short summary block. It is a simple baseline for
  contrast, scored with the same ground truth. It is not a measurement of any real product.

## How Jev is asked

- `state` = the current task (title and keywords) plus the last few messages.
- One `choice` question per tool result, with the tool name, size and a short preview:
  `keep` (still needed, keep it word for word), `trim` (only the gist matters, keep the head),
  `drop` (irrelevant now). Each option has a description.
- Questions are sent 100 per call, all calls at once. About 100 questions in one call is nearly
  free, which is the point of the demo.
- User and assistant messages are never judged and never touched.
- If the window is still above `target` x `budget` after Jev's verdicts, a pressure pass trims the
  keeps Jev was least sure about, then drops the weakest trims. Pinned blocks are never touched.

## The honest dial

`distraction` (0 to 1) is how much the junk output borrows the current task's words. At 0.12 the
mock run keeps about 98% of needle tokens and cuts about 81% of the window. At 0.5 recall is about
90%. At 0.9 junk looks like the task, Jev keeps much of it, the pressure pass has to squeeze
harder, and recall falls to about 78% with a cut of about 70%. On the same session the "summarize
instead" baseline keeps about 49%. No randomness is injected into the judge.
`test/viewer.test.mjs` proves the gap.

## Play with it

- Task buttons change the current task. The next compaction keeps different blocks.
- Click a block to inspect it: kind, size, preview, Jev's verdict with probability bars and the
  true label. Pin it and it is never dropped.
- Budget and distraction sliders, "Compact now", "Flood +40", pause, step and reset.
- Pane changes are runtime overrides. Any edit to `session.json` puts the file back in charge.

## Bring your own transcript

Put a real coding-agent transcript in the workspace and set `"source": "my-session.jsonl"` in
`session.json`. The pane switches from "synthetic demo" to "your transcript": it shows the whole
session as a tower, Jev judges every tool result (task = your last user message, 100 questions per
call), and the viewer writes `compaction-plan.json`: per tool result its index, line, tool, input
summary, tokens, verdict and probabilities, plus the totals. You can pick another user message as
the task, pin blocks and compact again.

Be clear about what this is: **an analysis of what Jev would cut and how much it would save. It is
not a plugin. It does not change any live session.** There is no ground truth for a real session,
so needle recall, the truth strip and the baseline lane are hidden. Token counts are estimates
(characters / 4).

- Claude Code transcripts live under `~/.claude/projects/<project folder>/<session>.jsonl`. A
  simple generic format also works: lines of `{ "role", "name"?, "input"?, "content" }`.
- The file must be inside the workspace, not under `.harness`, and at most 64 MB. Lines that do not
  parse are skipped and counted.
- The transcript's content is never written anywhere. The plan and the verdict hold tool names,
  input summaries (a file path, a command) and numbers.
- With no Jev key on your machine (environment or credentials file) nothing leaves it and the
  offline mock judges. With a key, the task
  message, the last few messages and about the first 300 characters of each tool result are sent
  to the Jev API.

## Jev, honestly

With `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` set, the viewer calls the real API (`POST /v1/systemone`). Without it, a
deterministic local mock answers. The mock reads only what live Jev would get: the state text and
the question text. It counts shared words and looks at the shape of the preview. It is a stand-in
for the plumbing, not for Jev's judgement, and the pane badges it `MOCK`. Times shown on the mock
are the mock's times, not Jev's. Cost is what live Jev would charge for the same input tokens
($0.042 per million input tokens).

## Measured with the real model

One short run on 2026-09-20 with live Jev (`typesafe/jev-1.13`) through OpenRouter, about 0.45 s a call once warm. Small samples on made-up data: a sanity check, not a benchmark.

14 compactions of the made-up session at distraction 0.12: needle recall 95.6%, average reduction
76.1%, 684 questions in 14 calls (about 49 questions a call, about 0.57 s a call), $0.0066. The toy
summarize baseline kept 48.8% of the needle tokens on the same session.
