"""The marimo pane: `marimo edit --watch` on the workspace notebook, tuned for a pane beside an agent.

marimo is started exactly as `marimo edit` starts it, with three settings layered over whatever the
user's own marimo config says, for this server only (nothing is written to disk):

- runtime.auto_instantiate = true   the notebook runs when the pane opens, so the reader sees
                                     outputs, charts and tables, not a column of stale code cells.
- runtime.watcher_on_save = autorun the agent's saves re-run the cells they changed, in place:
                                     the pane follows the work without a reload, and the user keeps
                                     their scroll position and the values of the sliders they moved.
- save.autosave = off               the agent owns notebook.py. Poking at the pane never rewrites
                                     the file under the agent's feet; Cmd-S still saves on purpose.

The overrides go in through marimo's own `MarimoConfigManager.with_overrides`, the same mechanism
marimo uses for its CLI flags, by wrapping the config-manager factory `marimo._server.start` calls.
MARIMO_VERSION pins the marimo this is written against; if a newer marimo moves the factory, the pane
still starts, with marimo's defaults, and says so on stderr.
