# MuJoCo, as a Harness agent

[Harness](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness) agent package for
[MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org): describe a robot, a scene, a controller, a policy in the chat pane;
the MuJoCo Viewer pane runs it — MuJoCo's own WebAssembly build, live in the browser, like
`simulate`: push the robot, drive its actuators, inspect contacts and sensors, replay the recording
frame by frame. Menagerie robots (Unitree Go2, G1, H1, Berkeley Humanoid, Booster T1) come with it;
MJX and MuJoCo Playground are one script away for training. Runs on Claude Code.

- `harness.json` — engine, template, skill, toolchain, `viewer.use: autonomous/mujoco-viewer`.
- `toolchain/setup.sh` — one venv on Python 3.12 (uv brings it when the machine has none) with the
  pinned MuJoCo (`VERSIONS`), which has no Intel Mac build — Apple Silicon Macs and Linux — and a sparse
  checkout of the Menagerie robots at a pinned commit; `install-training.sh` adds JAX, MJX and Playground;
  `harness_mujoco.py` loads (`servos=` turns torque motors into position servos), records and holds
  poses; `verdict.py` judges the rollout and names the trajectory as the artifact — never the video.
- **What a rollout is** (`record`, all under `out/`): `rollout.qpos.json` — per frame `time`, `qpos`,
  `qvel`, `ctrl`, written while it runs (`status: recording → done`) — which the pane re-simulates
  live; `rollout.model.xml`, the compiled model when it was built with `MjSpec`, plus `model_patch`
  for runtime edits, so the pane runs the model that was simulated; `rollout.json`, the report; and
  `rollout.mp4` (optional, `video=False`) for sharing.
- `skills/mujoco/` — the MuJoCo skill (ours). `template/` — a Go2 standing on position servos, and a pendulum MJCF.

**On a Mac, training runs JAX on the CPU** — enough for a smoke test, hours for a policy. A GPU machine
in Harness's Machines menu is where a real run belongs; the same workspace works there.

## Credit and stewardship

MuJoCo is Google DeepMind's — [google-deepmind/mujoco](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco),
Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE-mujoco`) — and so is the [MuJoCo Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie)
(Apache-2.0, with each robot's own licence in its folder — the Unitree models are BSD-3-Clause, Unitree
Robotics). Nothing of either is changed here; MuJoCo is installed from PyPI as released and the
Menagerie is fetched at a pinned commit. This folder is the Harness wrapper — the manifest, a
skill, the helper, the template, the verdict — written by Autonomous to bring MuJoCo into Harness,
on the project's behalf, to bootstrap the catalogue.

If you maintain MuJoCo or the Menagerie and want to own this package, it is yours: open an issue on
[OpenHarness](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness/issues) and we move this folder into a
repository of yours and point the registry entry at it. Until then: bugs in MuJoCo belong upstream, bugs in the
wrapper belong here, and a newer MuJoCo or Menagerie is a bump of `VERSIONS`.

```sh
harness dsh check .                                        # conformance
harness dsh install "$PWD" --link                          # this checkout as the installed agent
python3 -m unittest toolchain/test_verdict.py              # the verdict, without mujoco
.venv/bin/python -m unittest toolchain/test_record.py      # what record() writes for the pane
```
