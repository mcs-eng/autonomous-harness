/**
 * Per-turn recap for a `provider` machine — the device's tile text.
 *
 * Two sources, in this order:
 *
 *  1. **The provider's own**, through `agent.recap`. This is a PULL by design, so it is asked for
 *     rather than pushed, and it is authoritative when the provider has one.
 *  2. **Derived here**, when it answers with nothing. The backend does NOT run a model for this: it
 *     excerpts the turn's own assistant output. That keeps recap generation where it belongs (the
 *     engine that produced the turn) and still gives the device something true to show, instead of an
 *     empty tile for every provider that does not summarise.
 *
 * The caps are the wire's, not ours to pick: `recap` ≤ 200 comes from the recap schema, and 2000 for
 * the body is what the node path and the `harness` CLI both use for a commander part. Nothing here
 * ever appends an ellipsis — the same rule `capRecap` enforces in
 * `machine-node/brain/src/prefrontal/recap.ts`, because a truncated line that ADVERTISES its
 * truncation reads worse on a round 466px display than one that simply ends.
 *
 * Spec: autonomous-ai/openharness → provider/spec/README.md.
