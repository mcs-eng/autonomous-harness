/**
 * The transcript behind `session_get` for a `provider` machine.
 *
 * A provider has no sessions: one agent is one continuous transcript, fetched with `agent.history`
 * and windowed by `{limit, before}`. History is REQUIRED of every provider, so there is no
 * "undeclared" branch here any more — it either answers or it errors.
 *
 * The field names on OUR side are not a new invention and must not become one: `{limit, before}` in
 * and `{hasMore, oldestCursor, staleCursor}` out is exactly the pager the node path already speaks
 * (`machine-node/api/src/routes/websocket.ts` `session_get`, `SessionService.getSessionDetail`) and
 * the web already drives (`web/src/lib/store/slices/messagesSlice/sessionActions.ts`). A provider
 * machine has to be indistinguishable from a node one by the time the frame reaches the client — so
 * the provider's `nextBefore` is translated into that pager here, and never leaked upward.
 *
 * Spec: autonomous-ai/openharness → provider/spec/README.md.

 * JSONL shape** (`msg.message.content[]`). A provider speaks neither, so the fallback would drop every
 * entry on `if (!msg.message?.content) continue` and a provider transcript would render as an empty
 * chat no matter how much history came back. Mapping to `events` is the honest translation.
 *
 * It goes through the SAME `eventToFrame` a live turn does — and now on the same objects, since
 * `agent.history` returns exactly what the stream emitted. A replayed transcript and the live view
 * cannot disagree about the same event, because there is only one shape and one mapper.
