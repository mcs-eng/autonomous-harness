/**
 * The `provider` machine backer — the node role played over HTTP + SSE.
 *
 * Unlike every other backer there is **no persistent connection**. The protocol is request-per-turn,
 * so this module holds no socket, needs no owning worker, and does not appear in the
 * `down:{machineId}` subscription at all: the worker that receives a client frame calls the provider
 * itself (see `routeDown`). That is what removed the owner-election and multiplexing problems from
 * the WebSocket design this replaced.
 *
 * A provider machine is therefore **always online** — see `isAlwaysOnline`. Failure surfaces on the
 * turn that hit it, which is more precise than a status dot: "credential rejected" and "provider
 * unreachable" are different sentences, and a dot cannot say either.
 *
 * **A PROVIDER HAS NO SESSIONS — ONLY AGENTS.** One agent is one continuous transcript, and the
 * protocol keys everything on `agentId`. The web, however, keys its ENTIRE turn lifecycle on
 * `dbSessionId`: without one the user's own message is never revealed, the `__pending__` spinner
 * never migrates onto a real session, and the input sits on "sending…" forever while every event
 * arrives correctly. So the session is SYNTHESISED here — `sessionId === agentId`, one per agent —
 * and the clients keep the exact shape they already speak. Nothing above this file can tell the
 * difference; that is the point.
