# Follow your curiosity. Build across disciplines.

OpenHarness is open-source software and hardware for building with coding agents. Use Claude Code,
Codex, and others to make software, design parts and circuit boards, explore data, and create videos,
with your agents, domain tools, and live viewers in one place and sessions that persist across every
machine you own.

> **Community Windows 11 preview:** this fork adds a native Windows desktop with
> a WSL2 backend and a matching bundled CLI. [Download the Windows preview](https://github.com/mcs-eng/autonomous-harness/releases)
> · [Setup and limitations](desktop/WINDOWS_QUICKSTART.md).
> Independent MIT-licensed fork of Autonomous's OpenHarness; not an official
> Autonomous Windows release. The upstream project is described below.

The old rule said ten thousand hours to a craft. That was the tax on curiosity, and most of us could
only afford to pay it once, so we specialized and called the rest hobbies.

Coding agents become the specialists, given the tools of a craft and a way to see what they made:
the geometry that becomes a part, the netlist that becomes a circuit board, the script that becomes
a film. You bring the idea, the taste, and the judgment about what is worth making.

Use the desktop app on its own, or add the optional **Harness device** to follow your agents, answer
their questions, and speak new tasks from your desk. The app, firmware, schematics, PCB layouts, and
enclosure CAD files are all open source.

## For polymaths in the making.

> “I think that one kind of perspective for a lot of the world-class entrepreneurs is they’re not

Built for the curious engineer who wants to build beyond software. Get your hands on more of what
you are making, from the physical product to the analysis and the launch video. Makers and creators
with the same curiosity are welcome. You get there by directing a specialist in each craft and
judging what comes back, not by mastering them all first.

Monday, a feature. Tuesday, the customer data. Wednesday, an enclosure for the prototype. Thursday,
the launch video. You already know how to build with code, and Harness brings that way of working to
CAD, circuit boards, games, videos, and documents, with agents and tools for each craft.

Your ideas can take you into unfamiliar crafts: an app, a physical product, a game, a film. This is
a place to follow them. Give each job an agent with the right tools, inspect what it makes, and steer
the next iteration. The code and project files are there to read, change, version, and build on.

**From handoff to hands-on.** You bring intent and judgment; your agents write and run code. Each
harness supplies the tools and feedback for a different craft. You can get your hands on more of
the product and the work of bringing it to customers.

Start with what you know and learn the next craft through the things you build. The
[ideal-user guide](docs/ideal-users.md) records who we're building for and how the app, community,
and device serve them.

## Domain-specific harnesses (DSH)

**Coding agents can build far more than software.** Code is the common medium: geometry scripts make
parts, animation code makes videos, and analysis code turns data into charts and findings. That is
what connects the dots between crafts, and a harness gives the agent the tools and feedback to work
in each one.

<img width="1000" height="563" alt="harness" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25c63335-279a-4f9a-b702-2ffaec2b096f" />


A **domain-specific harness** turns a coding agent into a specialist. It brings the domain's
instructions and skills, a pinned toolchain, a project template, a verdict the app can read, and a
**live viewer** for what the agent makes. You chat on one side; the board, the part, the robot or the
game takes shape on the other, and stays interactive after the agent is done.

A DSH is a folder with a `harness.json`. The agent does the reasoning; the harness brings the tools
and the view. Adding a domain never needs a change to the app or the daemon.

These are the 48 harnesses currently listed in the Store catalog. They combine upstream
open-source tools and original workflows, with instructions, setup, checks, and live views for each craft.

The 10 [shared viewers](store/viewers/) cover CAD, 3D models, documents, games, film, video,
MuJoCo, web pages, isolated web previews, and studios. Viewer packages install alongside the
harnesses that need them. Experimental packages marked unlisted are not included above.
<!-- store-catalog:end -->

**The harness we'd love to see next is the one for your craft.** Bring an open-source tool you use,
a workflow you know well, or your own company's toolchain. A harness can live in this repository or
in yours.

Every picture is real output from the harness's own toolchain, and the prompt is the one that made it.

## Coding agents, on every machine

Keep the agents doing that work together, wherever they run.

- **Real terminals that outlive the window.** Every agent runs in a persistent tmux session. Close the
  app and the agents keep working; if tmux goes down with a reboot, the daemon brings the panes back and
  resumes the sessions.
- **Every engine, no wrappers.** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, Hermes, Command Code, Devin,
  Muse Code, Amp, Kilo, Grok Build, Antigravity and GitHub Copilot. OpenHarness reads the transcript each
  agent already writes and installs the vendor's own hooks. Your credentials stay in `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` and
  so on. See the [engine list](docs/engines.md).
- **All your machines in one window.** The laptop, the Mac mini at home, the server in the rack. Each
  runs a daemon with outbound connections only. Terminal traffic is end-to-end encrypted, the relay only
  forwards ciphertext, and it goes peer to peer over WebRTC when it can. No SSH server, VPN, or open
  port.
- **Built for many agents at once.** Split panes, a keyboard-driven layout, fuzzy search across
  sessions and machines (**⌘O**), and one shortcut to the agents waiting on you (**⇧⌘I**). The
  [workspace guide](docs/app.md) and [keybindings](docs/keyboard.md) cover the rest.

### Run it

1. [Download the desktop app](https://harness.autonomous.ai/desktop) for macOS or Linux.
2. Sign in to a coding agent you already use, with your own subscription, API key, or local model.
3. Press **⌘N**, pick an agent or a harness, a machine and a project, and start.

On another machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://harness.autonomous.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
harness login
harness start
```

Then **Machines → Link Machine** in the app.

macOS is the primary tested platform. Linux builds exist and feature parity is in progress; Windows is
work in progress. Embedded live viewers require macOS; remote viewers also need a current Harness
CLI on both machines. The app and daemon still need a Harness account to start;
[account-free local use is tracked](docs/development.md#account-free-local-use).

<details>
<summary><b>Build from source</b></summary>

For macOS, install Node.js 20+, tmux, Xcode, and Flutter 3.47+ / Dart 3.13+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness.git
cd openharness
(cd cli && npm ci)
make install-cli
cd desktop
flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos
```

`make install-cli` installs this checkout's CLI and restarts the local daemon. The
[development guide](docs/development.md) covers tests and isolated environments.

### How it fits together

```mermaid

  device["Harness device"] -- USB --> daemon
  app["Harness app<br/>(Flutter)"] -- loopback --> daemon["harness daemon<br/>(TypeScript)"]
  daemon --> tmux["tmux"] --> agents["Claude Code · Codex · OpenCode · …"]
  daemon --> dsh["DSH toolchain<br/>+ live viewer"]
  daemon <-- "E2EE · WebRTC" --> relay["Harness relay"]
  relay <--> remote["daemons on your<br/>other machines"]
```

The [architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) covers the daemon, the session model, transport and
encryption.

## Your first DSH in ten minutes

The [Hello World example](store/examples/hello-world/) is a Codex session that edits an HTML page
shown in the shared Web Viewer:

```text
hello-world/
  harness.json
  AGENTS.md             # instructions for the agent
  template/index.html   # copied into a new project
```

Its manifest connects the pieces:

```json
{
  "spec": 1,
  "id": "examples/hello-world",
  "name": "Hello World",
  "engine": "codex",
  "workspace": {
    "template": "template",
    "marker": "index.html"
  },
  "agent": { "instructions": "AGENTS.md" },
  "viewer": { "use": "autonomous/web-viewer" }
}
```

The CLI and the package protocol call a harness a DSH, so the commands are `harness dsh …`. From this
checkout, with the `harness` CLI installed:

```bash
harness dsh install "$PWD/store/viewers/web-viewer" --link
cp -R store/examples/hello-world ../my-first-harness
harness dsh check ../my-first-harness
harness dsh install ../my-first-harness --link
```

Press **⌘N → Hello World**, choose a new project, and ask it to “Say hello to Ada.” The agent edits
`index.html`; the viewer reloads. Change `AGENTS.md` to try another workflow, then start a new session.
`--link` keeps the package connected to your source directory; Store installs resolve viewer
dependencies on their own.

The [authoring guide](store/README.md) covers the full manifest, toolchains, live progress, verdicts,
store pages, and publishing; the [package specification](store/spec/README.md) is the contract.

| Piece | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Engine | Runs the coding agent: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and the rest |
| Harness (DSH) | Packages a domain: engine, instructions, toolchain, workspace, and viewer |
| Viewer | Shows and interacts with what the agent makes; shared across harnesses |
| Session | One running agent, in one project, on one machine |

## Harness device

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/hardware/answer.jpg" width="960" alt="A finger taps the round Harness device to answer an agent that redesigned the billing controls">
</p>

The optional **Harness device** is a round, always-on display that sits beside
your keyboard and shows your agents at a glance: what each one is doing, which one has finished, and
which one is waiting on you. Read a question and answer it on the screen, or tap and speak a new task,
without switching windows.

It is open hardware, all the way down. This repository has everything it takes to build one:

| Layer | What's here |
|---|---|
| [Firmware](devices/harness-device/firmware/) | ESP32-S3, ESP-IDF, a 466 × 466 round AMOLED with touch, microphones and audio. Connects to the host's daemon over USB — no Wi-Fi setup, no account on the device. |
| [PCB](devices/harness-device/hardware/pcb/) | The EasyEDA Pro project, the schematic, Gerbers, the bill of materials, and pick-and-place data for assembly. |
| [Enclosure](devices/harness-device/hardware/3d/) | STEP for editing and STL for printing: the housing, an iron counterweight base, the USB clamp, and the button. |

[**Get a Harness device**](https://www.autonomous.ai/harness), or build your own from these files. The
[firmware guide](devices/harness-device/firmware/README.md) lists the supported boards and build
commands, and the [hardware guide](devices/harness-device/hardware/README.md) covers the design files.

## Contributing

There are three ways in, one for each layer of the stack.

- **Make a DSH for a tool you use.** Start from Hello World, make one workflow work end to end, pin the
  toolchain, credit the upstream project, and show something worth looking at in the viewer.
- **Improve the coding workspace.** Terminal behavior, engine support, the daemon, the relay, Linux and
  Windows.
- **Hack the hardware.** Port the firmware to another board, remix the enclosure, add a feature to the
  device.

Small fixes and notes about something that didn't work are welcome too. The
[contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) walks through each path.
