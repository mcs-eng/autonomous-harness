### Every agent, side by side

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Devin, Amp, Copilot and seven more.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/agents.gif" width="960" alt="Four agents working at once in one window: Claude Code and Codex on a MacBook, Cursor on an office desktop, OpenCode on a GPU box. Each pane shows its machine, project and branch."></p>

### Every machine, side by side

Your laptop, home server and GPU box in one window. Link each one with a password.
No SSH keys. No Tailscale. No port forwarding.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/machines.gif" width="960" alt="A new GPU box runs four setup commands and comes online. The app links it with its password, then starts Claude Code there."></p>

### Keyboard first

⌘O finds any session on any machine. ⇧⌘I jumps to the agent waiting on you. ⌘D splits. Every key remaps.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/keyboard.gif" width="960" alt="Keyboard only: open a session by typing a few letters, zoom it, jump to the agent asking a question and answer it, then split a new pane below."></p>

### End-to-end encrypted

Code, keys and keystrokes are sealed on your machine. The relay forwards bytes it can't read.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/e2ee.gif" width="960" alt="On the left, an agent rotates a secret and redeploys. On the right, the same session as the relay sees it: numbered frames of ciphertext."></p>

### Fast and light

A native app, not Electron. Close it and your agents keep working.

We measure the workflows developers repeat, including their slow tails. Release
build on an M2 Max; 120 observations per action, with 16 retained terminals and
four visible:

| Developer action | Idle median | Idle p95 | p95 during output |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Type → terminal echo | 11.2 ms | 18.5 ms | 74.2 ms |
| ⌘N input-ready new harness | 10.6 ms | 15.0 ms | 14.4 ms |
| ⌘O open anything | 12.3 ms | 16.1 ms | 16.9 ms |
| Filter the session picker | 10.0 ms | 13.6 ms | 14.9 ms |
| Select a session → first input echo | 26.1 ms | 31.1 ms | 35.9 ms |
| ⌘T new tab | 13.2 ms | 18.1 ms | 18.0 ms |
| Next tab → first input echo | 27.2 ms | 34.2 ms | 42.6 ms |
| Focus pane → first input echo | 23.9 ms | 30.6 ms | 37.3 ms |
| Zoom a pane | 55.3 ms | 100.9 ms | 326.0 ms |
| Type Find query → results | 10.1 ms | 13.1 ms | 14.0 ms |
| Scroll one viewport | 40.9 ms | 83.2 ms | 139.6 ms |

Framework input to completed Flutter raster, with verified focus and results.
Output is an eight-row ANSI redraw at 20 Hz. These use synthetic sessions;
physical keyboard, network and display-presentation time are excluded.
Output-heavy typing, zoom and scrolling remain the main latency targets.

Real terminal round trips are measured separately, through disposable PTYs on
actual machines. The local installed-daemon baseline is **1.1 ms median / 7.2 ms
p95**, or 11.1 ms p95 during output (600 echoes per workload).

For remote machines, we compare all three routes on the **same target** and verify
the nominated ICE pair and both binary wire directions. Three attempts per route;
200 echoes per workload per successful trial:

| Target / route | Idle median | Idle p95 | p95 during output | Trials completed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Office iMac · Direct P2P | 14.6 ms | 135.0 ms | 37.7 ms | 1/3 |
| Office iMac · Cloudflare TURN | 109.8 ms | 163.8 ms | 175.9 ms | 3/3 |
| Office iMac · Harness relay | 401.4 ms | 504.7 ms | 512.0 ms | 3/3 |
| Home iMac · Direct P2P | Unavailable | — | — | 0/3 |
| Home iMac · Cloudflare TURN | 108.5 ms | 167.8 ms | 180.2 ms | 3/3 |
| Home iMac · Harness relay | 384.7 ms | 503.3 ms | 501.1 ms | 3/3 |

Direct P2P was fast when it connected, but its availability varied in this run.
All five failed direct-only attempts reached their PTYs through the fallback
relay; they are retained as unavailable P2P trials. All 5,200 measured echoes and
390 measured control requests completed, and all 18 test terminals were deleted.

Remote trials use an isolated production transport client. These round trips
exclude UI rendering; adding independent p95 values would not produce an
end-to-end p95. Setup and warm reattachment are measured separately.
[Route methodology, failures, tails and raw observations](docs/performance/2026-09-23-transport-routes.md).

Desktop app resource use with 1,000 seeded lines per retained terminal:

| Retained terminals | App foreground / hidden CPU | App foreground / hidden footprint |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0.08% / 0.08% | 213 / 217 MiB |
| 16 | 0.09% / 0.10% | 304 / 306 MiB |
| 48 | 0.10% / 0.08% | 559 / 559 MiB |

Thirty-second process snapshots; 100% CPU means one core. Memory is median
physical footprint of the **desktop app alone**, including its terminal renderer
and scrollback. The 213 MiB one-terminal result contains no Claude Code, Codex,
shell, tmux, or Harness daemon process memory. Those need separate process
measurements; their usage was not measured in this fixture. Hidden fixtures still
recorded 12–14 interrupt wakeups/s; these measurements do not establish zero background
work in a connected app.

With 16 full 10,000-line buffers and ongoing output, the fixture used about
957 / 960 MiB and 1.28% / 1.79% of one core in foreground / hidden samples.

[Full results, workload definitions, limits and raw observations](docs/performance/2026-09-23-core-experiences.md).

### Built the way developers work

- **Real terminals.** Every agent runs in its own tmux pane. Scrollback, colors and keys just work.
- **Your CLIs, as they are.** Harness never wraps an agent. It reads transcripts and uses the vendor's own hooks.
- **A worktree per harness.** Start an agent on its own branch. Your working copy stays clean.
- **Remap every key.** One JSONC file, reloaded on save. Chords up to four strokes.
- **Local models.** Run open-weight models on your own machines with Grid, Ollama, MLX-LM and vLLM.
- **Bytes, not pixels.** Remote terminals stream text peer to peer. No remote desktop.
- **Open source, all of it.** App, CLI, daemon, relay and device, in this repo.

## How it works

One daemon per machine runs your agents in tmux. It dials out, so no machine opens a port.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph laptop["Your laptop"]
    app["Harness app"] -- loopback --> d1["daemon"]
    d1 --> a1["tmux · Claude Code · Codex"]
  end
  subgraph box["Your GPU box"]
    d2["daemon"] --> a2["tmux · OpenCode · Hermes"]
  end
  device["Harness device"] -- USB --> d1
  d1 <-. "direct WebRTC" .-> d2
  d1 <-- "ciphertext" --> relay["Harness relay · no keys"]
  relay <-- "ciphertext" --> d2
```

Every path is sealed end to end: ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519 session keys, pinned Ed25519 identities.
Harness picks the best path on its own.

**Direct.** A WebRTC channel between your machines. No server in the path.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/connect/direct.gif" width="800" alt="The Harness window connects straight to home-server, office-desktop, cloud-server and mac-mini over WebRTC, with no server in the path."></p>

**Through Cloudflare.** When a firewall blocks the direct path, the same encrypted channel runs over
Cloudflare's TURN network. Harness keeps trying for a direct path.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/connect/cloudflare.gif" width="800" alt="The encrypted WebRTC channel passes through the nearest Cloudflare edge when a firewall blocks the direct path."></p>

**Through our relay.** A fallback while WebRTC negotiates. The relay holds no keys and forwards ciphertext.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/connect/relay.gif" width="800" alt="The Harness relay keeps the session reachable over its WebSocket while WebRTC negotiates. It holds no keys."></p>

## Beyond code: Build across disciplines

> “World-class entrepreneurs are polymaths.” — [Peter Thiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10kXgTdhNU&t=811s)

Coding agents can build far more than software. Give one a harness and it works with the real
tools of a craft. You steer in a live viewer. Every clip below is a real session.

### Beyond code: Design

**[Blender](store/agents/blender/).** Ask for a lamp and the sliders that matter. Turn them and Blender rebuilds the geometry. Keep the versions you love.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/blender.gif" width="800" alt="Shape Lab in Blender: dragging height and twist sliders rebuilds a ribbon lamp, and chosen designs are kept."></p>

### Beyond code: Circuits

**[CircuitJS](store/agents/circuitjs/).** Build a filter. Change one resistor. Overlay the new trace, measure the difference and keep both.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/circuitjs.gif" width="800" alt="Scope Lab in CircuitJS: an RC filter captured at 1 kΩ and 2 kΩ, traces overlaid and measured with cursors."></p>

### Beyond code: Robotics

**[MuJoCo](store/agents/mujoco/).** Pin a moment in a robot's run. Shove it with 100 N. Watch two futures split.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/mujoco.gif" width="800" alt="A Unitree Go2 in MuJoCo: the original and shoved futures play together with a height chart."></p>

### Beyond code: Games

**[Godogen](store/agents/godogen/).** Your agent makes a playable game. Miss a jump, rewind, try again. Pin the moment so the agent sees what you mean.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/godogen.gif" width="800" alt="Alpine Drift, a game made with Godogen: a run is rewound, retried and a moment is pinned with feedback."></p>

### Beyond code: Music

**[Strudel](store/agents/strudel/).** The track is code you can perform. Bring voices in and out, mark the good parts, keep the WAV. [Hear it](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d4381b-5f55-406c-9d68-330cd8792fc5).

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/strudel.gif" width="800" alt="A live Strudel performance: voice lanes play beside the code, and the take is kept with markers."></p>

### Beyond code: Chemistry

**[RDKit](store/agents/rdkit/).** Turn a bond and watch the molecule move. Follow the real energy curve. Keep the pose worth a closer look.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/rdkit.gif" width="800" alt="A bond scan in RDKit: the molecule rotates through sampled poses along an MMFF94 energy curve."></p>

### Beyond code: Documents

**[Typst](store/agents/typst/).** Your agent writes a real PDF. Circle a detail, quote a line, leave a note. The next draft answers it.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/typst.gif" width="800" alt="A Typst PDF under review: notes are pinned to an area and a sentence, then carried to the next draft."></p>

### Beyond code: Data

**[Jev Sheets](store/agents/jev-sheets/).** Test a question on a few frozen rows before you ask the whole sheet. Compare two wordings side by side.

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/beyond/jev-sheets.gif" width="800" alt="Question Lab in Jev Sheets: two wordings of a question are compared on frozen rows, recorded with practice data."></p>

## Domain-specific harnesses (DSH)

Code is the common medium. Geometry scripts make parts. Netlists make boards. Animation code makes film.

A **domain-specific harness** turns a coding agent into a specialist. It brings the craft's
instructions and skills, a pinned toolchain, a project template, checks and a **live viewer**.
You chat on one side. The board, the part or the game takes shape on the other.

The agent does the reasoning. The harness brings the tools and the view. It's a folder with a
`harness.json`, so adding a craft never touches the app.

### Build your own

The next harness is the one for your craft. Wrap a tool you love or your team's toolchain.
It can live here or in your own repo. From this repo:

```json
{
  "spec": 1,
  "id": "examples/hello-world",
  "name": "Hello World",
  "engine": "codex",
  "workspace": { "template": "template", "marker": "index.html" },
  "agent": { "instructions": "AGENTS.md" },
  "viewer": { "use": "autonomous/web-viewer" }
}
```

```bash
harness dsh install "$PWD/store/viewers/web-viewer" --link
cp -R store/examples/hello-world ../my-harness
harness dsh check ../my-harness
harness dsh install ../my-harness --link
```

Press **⌘N → Hello World** and say hello. The [authoring guide](store/README.md) covers the rest.

## Harness device

<p align="center"><img src=".github/assets/readme/device.gif" width="960" alt="A finger taps the round Harness device, speaks a task to fix the login flow, and the device shows the agent deploying, then a summary of the shipped fix."></p>

The optional **Harness device** is a round, always-on display that sits beside
your keyboard and shows your agents at a glance: what each one is doing, which one has finished, and
which one is waiting on you. Read a question and answer it on the screen, or tap and speak a new task,
without switching windows.

It is open hardware, all the way down. This repository has everything it takes to build one:

| Layer | What's here |
|---|---|
| [Firmware](devices/harness-device/firmware/) | ESP32-S3, ESP-IDF, a 466 × 466 round AMOLED with touch, microphones and audio. Connects to the host's daemon over USB — no Wi-Fi setup, no account on the device. |
| [PCB](devices/harness-device/hardware/pcb/) | The EasyEDA Pro project, the schematic, Gerbers, the bill of materials, and pick-and-place data for assembly. |
| [Enclosure](devices/harness-device/hardware/3d/) | STEP for editing and STL for printing: the housing, an iron counterweight base, the USB clamp, and the button. |

[**Get a Harness device**](https://www.autonomous.ai/harness), or build your own from these files. The
[firmware guide](devices/harness-device/firmware/README.md) lists the supported boards and build
commands, and the [hardware guide](devices/harness-device/hardware/README.md) covers the design files.
