# This is OPTIONAL. The flasher (apps/web/src/app/flash-circle.sh/flash-circle.sh) installs esptool by
# itself, from the vendor's release, verified against a sha256 it carries. The mirror exists for one
# case: an operations laptop on a network that blocks that download. It also pins the bytes, so the
# vendor cannot move them under us.
#
# The flasher SCRIPT is not published here — it is served by the web app at
# harness.autonomous.ai/flash-circle.sh and ships with a web deploy (same as /cli/install.sh). Nothing in
# this script touches metadata.json, so a mirror refresh can never disturb the fleet's OTA manifest.
#
# Prereqs: an authenticated `gcloud storage` with write access (objects must be public-read), plus curl.
