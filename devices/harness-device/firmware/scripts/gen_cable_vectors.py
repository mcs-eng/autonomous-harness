A THIRD implementation, written from the format description in main/cable_frame.h and from nothing
else. That is the entire point: the firmware (C) and the daemon (TypeScript, in the autonomous-harness
repository) each assert against this file, so a misreading shared by both halves shows up as a
disagreement with the vectors instead of being blessed by two implementations that copied each other.
The two halves live in different repositories and cannot import a line of code between them.

Format, tab-separated, `#` comments and blank lines ignored:

    encode  <name>  <type>  <payload-hex>  <frame-hex>
    stream  <name>  <input-hex>  <frames>  <discarded>  <corrupt>

`frames` is a comma-separated list of `type:payload-hex`, or `-` for none. `discarded` and `corrupt`
are the decoder counters after feeding the whole input. The stream cases are the valuable half: encoding
is arithmetic both sides get right, while resync after noise is where two readers actually diverge.
