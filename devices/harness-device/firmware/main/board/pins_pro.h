// Pin map for Harness Pro (ESP32-P4, 720x720 square LCD). Reached through board_pins.h, never directly.
//
// Module: WT01P4C5-S1 (Wireless-Tag) — ESP32-P4 + ESP32-C5 in one package, 16 MB flash, 32 MB hex PSRAM.
//
// EVERY NUMBER HERE WAS READ OFF A WORKING BOARD, not off the schematic: they come from the vendor's
// HARDWARE.md §10, which was written from the BSP that runs on this hardware. Where the schematic and
// that document disagree, the document wins — it is the one that has been on a bench.
//
// The ESP32-C5 half of the module is deliberately absent from this file. It is the Wi-Fi coprocessor,
// reachable only over an internal SDIO link (P4 GPIO14-19, reset on GPIO13), and this firmware has no
// network path of any kind: it talks to its daemon over the USB cable and nothing else (cable_link.h).
// So the C5 is never reset and never powered up, and its pins are left alone.
