/*
 * Harness Pro touch: opening a GT911 on the shared I2C bus.
 *
 * Only the opening. Everything a finger then does — the swipe tracker, the double-tap window, the edge
 * bands, the stuck-press watchdog, the reinit-on-silence loop — is ui/touch.c, unchanged, shared with
 * the dial. See touch_ctrl.h.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RESET SEQUENCE BELOW IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS FILE, and it is not a formality.
 *
 * A GT911 chooses its own I2C address from the level of its INT pin at the RISING EDGE of its RESET:
 * INT low picks 0x5D, INT high picks 0x14. So the pins have to be driven in one specific order, and the
 * order has to complete before anything probes the bus. Get it wrong — most easily by leaving INT
 * floating while reset is released — and the chip comes up at an address nobody is looking at, or does
 * not come up at all. The symptom is a touch controller that "is not on the bus", which sends you
 * looking at wiring that is fine.
 *
 * Because this is done by hand, the driver is then told GPIO_NUM_NC for its own reset pin. Given the
 * real pin it would pulse it again on open, with INT already switched to an input, and undo exactly the
 * choice made here. The dial has nothing like this: its CST controllers take a plain reset pulse.
