/**
 * Registry of process-owned AGENTS — one per supported top-level engine process in a tmux pane.
 *
 * An agent is created the moment process discovery observes it and lives exactly as long as that process.
 * The ENGINE
 * session is a mapping bound to the agent afterwards, and rebound whenever the engine rotates it
 * (`/clear`, `/new`) — the agent, its tab, its name and its place in the list do not move.
 *
 * Two indexes, because the outside world speaks both languages: `agentId` for anything the user
 * addresses, and a bare `sessionId` for turn control (`cancel`, `question_response`, `session_get`).
 * `resolve()` accepts either. Persisted to disk so a live agent survives a self-update restart.
 *
 * Module singleton (like the ws `clients` set) — imported by routes + reaper.
