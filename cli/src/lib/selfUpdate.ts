/**
 * Self-update mechanics — PURE (no process-control; the daemon decides when to restart).
 *
 * The daemon polls a GCS `metadata.json` (same shape as the device OTA manifest), and when a strictly
 * newer build is published it downloads `cli.js` + `notify.mjs`, verifies sha256 IN MEMORY (so a bad
 * download never touches disk), canary-runs the new bundle, then atomically swaps them into the install
 * dir (keeping a `.prev` for rollback). Firing the restart, supervising the new process, and rolling
 * back are all the CALLER's job (`restartForUpdate` in cli.ts) — this module only stages.
 *
 * Manifest entry shape (key = ADAPTER_UPDATE_KEY, coexists with the device `commander` key):
 *   { "adapter": { "version": "0.0.2",
 *                  "cli":    { "url": "…/cli.js",    "sha256": "…", "size": N },
 *                  "notify": { "url": "…/notify.mjs","sha256": "…", "size": M } } }
