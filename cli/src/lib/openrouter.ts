/**
 * One direct OpenRouter call, for the daemon's OWN small LLM jobs (turn recap, voice routing) on agents
 * that run through the gateway.
 *
 * Every other engine path in this file's neighbourhood spawns the user's vendor CLI, which works because
 * that CLI is logged in. A `ori claude` user may have no Anthropic account at all — their credential is
 * an OpenRouter key — so the vendor one-shot has nothing to spend and the recap silently never arrives.
 * Both jobs are a couple of hundred tokens of text condensation, so the answer is not "spawn a different
 * agent" but "make the request ourselves": no process, no pool slot, no vendor login, one HTTPS call.
 *
 * The key never leaves this module except in an Authorization header to openrouter.ai, and is redacted
 * from every message this module can produce.

/**
 * Matches the vendor one-shot's 60s (`oneshot.ts`), and for the same reason: this call REPLACES that
 * one, so a recap must not become less reliable by being routed through a gateway.
 *
 * It was 20s until a live run proved that wrong. OpenRouter spreads one model id across providers, and
 * the same `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` request measured 1.6s, 8.4s and >20s within ten minutes — the
 * 20s attempt aborted a recap that had already been paid for. A recap is asynchronous (the card arrives
 * when it arrives), so waiting is cheap and giving up early is not. Callers on a real deadline pass
 * their own: the voice router uses 12s, under the backend's 15s RPC budget.
