 * can see, and a stray one wins on its own terms. Measured, twice, on one machine:
 *
 *  * OpenCode, handed `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for a grid, found an inherited `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and chose
 *    Claude Sonnet at api.anthropic.com — reporting `invalid x-api-key`, a sentence that names
 *    neither the grid nor the variable that redirected it.
 *  * Claude Code, on the same machine, had its `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` deleted by a line in `.zshrc` and
 *    fell back to the same key, with the same unreadable result.
 *
 * The inherited value arrives from further away than a user can reasonably audit. On that machine it
 * came from `.zshrc`, and then — after that was fixed — from a VS Code setting
 * (`claudeCode.environmentVariables`) that seeded the terminal the desktop app was launched from,
 * whose environment the app passed to the daemon, which passed it to the tmux server, which gave it
 * to every pane. Four layers, none visible from the failure.
 *
 * So the launch is the place to settle it: it is the only point that knows the user asked for a grid.
 * Unset here is scoped to the engine's own process and touches nothing on disk — a plain terminal on
 * the same machine keeps every variable it had.
 *
 * The list is deliberately OUR OWN vars rather than a survey of every provider an engine supports.
 * Enumerating those is unbounded and would go stale silently; these are the ones the contracts use, so
 * this list can be right about them: lib/gridLaunch.spec.ts holds it to what the contracts set, each exception
