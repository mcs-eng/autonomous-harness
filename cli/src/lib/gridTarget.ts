/**
 * Where an engine is pointed when a person moves an agent onto a grid model, or starts one there — the

 * Its own module since grid-reads-without-waking issue 03: the model list (`gridModels.ts`) answers what
 * grids serve; this answers how one agent reaches one of them. The window comes from the model list's
 * credential-less picture, so resolving a target never reads a grid with its credential — waking one is
 * the prewarm's job, after the move (`gridModels.ts`, `gridWake.ts`).

/**
 * Everything an engine needs to be pointed at `gridName`, resolved on THIS machine.
 *
 * Deliberately not something a client sends. The app names a model; the endpoint and the credential
 * are read here, from the `grid` CLI that is already signed in, so no grid credential ever crosses
 * the relay and there is one source of truth for an address the app could not know anyway.
 *
 * ⚠️ The returned `apiKey` is a live credential. It goes into the engine's ENVIRONMENT and never into
 * argv or a log line — `gridLaunch.ts` is what enforces that, and this value must keep travelling
 * through it rather than around it.
 *
 * Web tools ride on the same credential: the control plane's MCP server accepts the inference token,
 * so `mcpUrl` is the only thing added here, and it is added FIRST. `grid mcp config` renews the token
 * when it is within a month of expiry and persists the renewal; `info --env` never renews, so asked
 * in the other order it could hand inference an older token than the one the web tools hold — both
 * valid, and a mismatch nobody would think to look for. A missing `mcpUrl` degrades rather than
 * refuses: inference is the feature, web search is an accessory (`gridMcpUrl.ts`).
