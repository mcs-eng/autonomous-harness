/**
 * A plan-driven fake `grid`, for specs that drive the daemon's `grid` subprocess seam.
 *
 * The real binary talks to a control plane, so the questions worth asking in a unit test are all
 * about which argv this daemon sends and what it believes about the answer. This fake answers each
 * verb from a JSON plan the test writes beside it, and appends every invocation to a log the test
 * reads back. Injected through `HARNESS_GRID_BIN`, which `gridExec.ts` prefers over the managed
 * runtime and PATH alike.
 *
 * One fake rather than one per spec: the verb-keyed plan, the `--remote` stripping and the
 * multi-turn answers are the parts that drift when copied, and a fake that means something slightly
 * different in each file is worse than none.
