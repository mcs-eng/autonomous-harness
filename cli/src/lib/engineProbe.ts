/**
 * Which engines does THIS machine actually have?
 *
 * The New Agent dialog lists every engine Harness supports. Whether a given machine has any of them
 * installed is a different question, and until this module existed it was only ever answered the
 * expensive way: create the agent, watch tmux run a command that does not exist, and read the
 * `ENGINE_NOT_INSTALLED` that came back. The dialog can ask first.
 *
 * ## It must run on the machine being asked about
 *
 * This is the whole reason the answer travels as a request rather than being computed in the app. A
 * developer's Mac and the Docker rig in `docker/remote-machine` routinely disagree — the rig ships
 * exactly one engine on purpose — and so do two laptops on one account. An availability list
 * computed locally and applied to a remote machine is wrong in the one case the feature exists for.
 *
 * ## It probes the binary the LAUNCH would use, not an alias
 *
 * [engineBin] is what `agent_create` puts in `command[0]`, so it is what has to resolve. Probing
 * `ENGINE_CLI_ALIASES` instead would let a machine answer "installed" for an alias the launch never
 * calls, which is a worse failure than no answer at all: the dialog would promise a create that
 * still cannot work.
 *
 * The probe itself is [commandAvailableInInteractiveShell] — the same call `cli.ts` already makes
 * when a create fails, in the same interactive shell a create launches through. Two different notions
 * of "installed" between the dialog and the launch is precisely the bug this avoids, so there is one
 * implementation and both sides call it.
 *
 * Note what that probe tests: `command -v`, then `-f` and `-x` on what it resolved. A DANGLING
 * SYMLINK — `~/.local/bin/hermes` pointing into a venv that was deleted — is therefore correctly
 * reported as not installed, which is the state a plain `command -v` gets wrong.
