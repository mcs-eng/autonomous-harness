/**
 * The private config directory an engine is given when its provider lives in a file.

 * Pi is the case this exists for: it reads providers out of a directory, and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
 * moves that directory. Rather than edit `~/.pi/agent/models.json` — someone else's file, which
 * would outlive the agent and survive every uninstall — the daemon writes a directory it owns and
 * points the engine at that. The user's own configuration is never opened, and deleting the
 * directory undoes the whole thing.
 *
 * Nothing written here is secret. A provider block references the key through an environment
 * variable; the key itself lives in the process environment — and, so a relaunch can put it back
 * there, in the registry row (`RegisteredSession.gridLaunch`), never in these files.
