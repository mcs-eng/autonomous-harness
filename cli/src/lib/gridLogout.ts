/**
 * Run `grid logout` as itself, and get out of the way.
 *
 * The grid sign-out is not a credential delete: it tears every serve child on this box down FIRST,
 * while the token that makes their deregistration authoritative still exists, and it refuses — keeping
 * the credentials — when a child cannot be confirmed stopped. `--force` walks away from that refusal.
 * All of it already exists, it has been got wrong once, and a second dialect of it here would be the
 * kind that drifts. So this module reproduces none of it: it spawns the child, inherits all three
 * streams, and hands back the child's exit code.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Nothing is wrapped, under `--json` or otherwise.** `harness grid login` has two halves to
 * reconcile and emits its own terminating result line; this command has ONE, so its standard output
 * is `grid logout`'s document verbatim and its standard error is `grid logout`'s sentence verbatim.
 * An envelope added here would be a second answer to a question the child has already answered.
 *
 * The one thing this module is entitled to say is that there was no child to run at all.
