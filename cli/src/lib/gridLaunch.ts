/**
 * Pointing an agent at an Autonomous Grid instead of the engine's own login.
 *
 * A client names a model and an opaque target. The daemon resolves that target into this override;
 * nothing about it reaches an engine by itself, so this module turns the server-owned result into
 * the launch — environment, and where the vendor demands it, argv.
 *
 * The one place that payload is kept is the registry row (`RegisteredSession.gridLaunch`, in a 0600
 * file this daemon owns) — so a restart, or a pane recreated after a reboot, relaunches onto the SAME
 * grid with the SAME key rather than silently coming back on the engine's own login. Nothing THIS
 * module writes (argv, a config directory) ever carries the key; that rule is unchanged.
 *
 * ## Every entry here is the vendor's own documented contract
 *
 * The relay speaks two dialects — Anthropic Messages at `<grid>/relay`, and OpenAI
 * chat/completions + responses at `<grid>/relay/v1` — so an engine can be pointed at it only if the
 * engine itself offers a way to change its endpoint. Those ways differ, and none of them is
 * guessable: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for Claude Code, `-c model_providers.*` argv for Codex,
 * `GROK_MODELS_BASE_URL` for Grok, `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` for Copilot. Each entry below cites
 * where it was read from.
 *
 * An engine with no entry is REFUSED, and the refusal names why for that engine specifically. Three
 * shapes of "no" appear, and they are worth telling apart because only one of them could ever change
 * on our side:
 *
 *   * **Wrong protocol.** The engine CAN be re-pointed, but at its own vendor's API rather than an
 *     OpenAI- or Anthropic-shaped one. Cursor Agent reads `CURSOR_API_ENDPOINT` (default
 *     `https://api2.cursor.sh`, read out of the shipped bundle) and Antigravity reads
 *     `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` — handing either the relay would send it a dialect the relay does not
 *     serve (grid ADR 0012 lists Gemini as a future data edit, not a served endpoint). A knob
 *     existing is not the same as a knob that helps, and pointing one of these at a grid would fail
 *     inside the app with an error naming neither.
 *   * **Config-file only** (pi, kilo): the provider block has to be written into the user's own
 *     dotfile. Editing another tool's configuration on someone's behalf is a side effect that
 *     outlives the agent, so this module does not do it.
 *   * **Nothing documented** (muse, commandcode, amp, devin): no vendor documentation describes an
 *     endpoint override. These are the entries that could gain a contract tomorrow — with a cited
 *     source, not a plausible-looking variable name.
 *
 * Refusing is the point. Silently launching against the engine's own login would put the agent
 * somewhere other than where the user said, spend the wrong account, and look like it worked.

/**
 * The provider block OpenCode reads, as JSON.
 *
 * Four things here are load-bearing, each of which breaks the engine differently when got wrong:
 *
 *  1. **No top-level `model` key on v1.** OpenCode 1.x's schema `$ref`s a CLOSED enum of known public
 *     models with no wildcard branch, so naming a private grid's model there makes OpenCode refuse
 *     the whole config at startup — a failure that arrives as a dead pane, long after the launch
 *     looked fine. The model is selected on argv instead, which is not schema-validated. v2 is the
 *     other way round: its TUI has no `-m`, and it accepts `model` naming the provider declared here
 *     (measured on 2.0.18: a fresh `--standalone` pane opened on it), so on v2 the key is written.
 *  2. **`baseURL` is the relay root verbatim.** It already ends in `/relay/v1`; the SDK appends
 *     `/chat/completions` itself, so any "normalising" here 404s every request.
 *  3. **`apiKey` is `{env:…}`, not the key.** Nothing written to disk by this module may contain a
 *     credential. This diverges from the advice a person following OpenCode's own docs gets — there
 *     the literal is recommended, because an unset variable silently becomes an empty string and a
 *     human-launched OpenCode has no guarantee the variable is set. Here it IS guaranteed: the
 *     daemon puts it in the pane's environment with `tmux new-session -e` before the engine starts.
 *  4. **`limit` only when the window is known, and then BOTH halves.** OpenCode requires `context`
 *     and `output` together and rejects the config given only one. It is how OpenCode knows how much
 *     room is left, so without it a session ran on until the relay refused a request as too long,
 *     never having compacted. Absent when the relay did not report a window: inventing one would be
 *     worse than OpenCode's own defaults. `output` is a quarter of the window, capped at OpenCode's
 *     own 32K output ceiling — it is also what OpenCode holds back from the window for the reply, so
 *     a larger share would compact a small window after every other turn.

  //
  // ## v2 (2.0.18, measured)
  //
  // The TUI rejects `-m` and exits 1, so the model goes in the config file instead (see
  // `opencodeGridConfig`, point 1). And by default the TUI attaches to ONE background service shared
  // by every OpenCode on the machine, which never sees a pane's `OPENCODE_CONFIG`: a session put on a
  // provider declared only here showed the service's default model in its footer. `--standalone`

  //
  // ⚠️ The ENDPOINT has no such flag. Hermes's custom-provider resolver deliberately ignores
  // `OPENAI_BASE_URL` ("config.yaml is the single source of truth for endpoint URLs",
  // `runtime_provider_backends.py`) and the CLI exposes no `--base-url`, so moving a hermes agent
  // between grids moves its model but leaves its requests on whatever relay config.yaml names. The
  // only lever left is `HERMES_HOME`, which would take state.db and the user's skills with it and
  // break the resume this move depends on.
  //
  // ⚠️ The overlay is the ONE thing here a machine can refuse. `HERMES_MANAGED_DIR` REPLACES
  // `/etc/hermes` rather than adding to it — so on a machine where an administrator pinned Hermes
  // settings there, writing ours would take their policy away for as long as the agent runs. The
  // agent still launches on the grid; it launches without web tools, which is the smaller loss and
  // the one the app can say out loud (`unsupported`). The machine fact arrives from the caller
  // (`GridLaunchMachine`); the decision is made here so create, retarget and restore cannot differ.

  // xAI's own Grok CLI (the one this repo discovers under `~/.grok`, whose transcripts carry the

  // and "when you set models_base_url, Grok uses API key auth instead of session auth" — the second
  // half of which does NOT hold in practice: measured, the variable moves where requests go but not
  // which credential is picked, and the session token still wins. See `grokGridConfig`. The model has
  // no documented variable, so it goes in argv AND into the config block that carries the credential.
  //
  // Its web tools cost it a private home. Grok reads `[mcp_servers]` from its config file and takes
  // no flag for them, and the only layer that both starts unattended and is not the user's own file
  // is `$GROK_HOME/config.toml` — the project layer is gated on a folder-trust prompt nobody is
  // there to answer, and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` does not move MCP discovery at all. See `gridWebMcp.ts`,
  // which measured each of them.
  //
  // ⚠️ `GROK_HOME` moves the WHOLE state directory, `sessions/` included — and for grok that is not
  // cosmetic: `cli.ts` drops an observed grok agent entirely when it can find no transcript, so an
  // un-borrowed home would launch an agent the harness never registers. The directory is linked back
  // rather than moved; [GROK_GRID_HOME_LINKS] says which, and why the list stops where it does.
  //
  // ⚠️ The private home is NOT optional, and the reason is the credential order rather than the web
  // tools. `XAI_API_KEY` is the LAST thing Grok reaches for — behind the OIDC session token — so an
  // agent launched with the documented variable pair alone authenticates as the user's own xAI login
  // and the relay answers 401. The config block declares the model with `env_key`, which outranks the
  // session token; `grokGridConfig` carries the measurement. So every grid launch writes a config,
  // web tools or not, and the user's own `~/.grok` is still never opened.

    // Deliberately NOT `requiresModel`. The credential rides on a declared model block, so a launch

    // like any other model (verified: `{"model":"Auto"}` → 200, answered by DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731),
    // so `Auto` is what the block declares. Verified end to end: Grok launched against `[model."Auto"]`
    // with `env_key` answered a prompt through the router with `auth_mode=null` and no probe.

    // Making this `requiresModel` was the first fix here and it was the wrong one: it turned "Auto",
    // the default the New Agent dialog shows, into a refusal at the moment of clicking Create —
