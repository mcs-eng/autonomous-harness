/**
 * Find the session a live discovered engine process is running, when no hook has bound one yet.
 *
 * Process discovery can see an engine immediately, including after a daemon restart, but a session id is
 * owned by the engine and may not be present in argv. Ask the engine's own store which session belongs to
 * that pane's directory and process start time.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest:
 *   - **Started after the engine process did.** A session older than the process cannot be the one it is
 *     running now. (Resumed agents name their id on the command line and are adopted from argv instead —
 *     see tmuxAgentDiscovery.)
 *   - **Unique or nothing.** Two candidate sessions in one directory means two agents there, and guessing
 *     would hand one agent's transcript to the other's tile. Ambiguity returns null; the agent stays
 *     unbound until its next turn, which is recoverable — mis-binding is not.
