#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Install the adapter CLI from THIS working tree into ~/.harness/cli — the local twin of
# scripts/upload-cli.sh with the GCS round-trip cut out. It produces exactly the layout the public
# installer does (the hosted installer), so afterwards `harness` on this computer IS
# your build. Nothing is uploaded, nothing is version-bumped, nothing is git-committed.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/install-cli.sh               # bundle -> install -> restart the daemon if it was running
#   bash scripts/install-cli.sh --no-build    # install the existing dist/ as-is
#   bash scripts/install-cli.sh --no-restart  # swap the bytes, leave the daemon stopped
#   bash scripts/install-cli.sh --no-updates  # pin this build: turn self-update OFF (default: ON)
#
# SELF-UPDATE STAYS ON BY DEFAULT, and the version label is what makes that safe. The build is labelled
# `<published-core>-dev.<sha>`, and shouldAutoUpdate() (lib/selfUpdate.ts) refuses to replace ANY
# `-dev.` build automatically — so no release, however far ahead, overwrites your bytes on its own.
#
# It did not always: the rule used to be ordering alone (semverGt on the X.Y.Z core), which let the
# release you were level with sit still but let the NEXT one land. That reads like being carried
# forward and behaves like losing your work — a machine developing against unreleased CLI code had its
# bundle swapped mid-session, and the only symptom was the unreleased feature quietly not working.
#
# So: nothing here pins the computer, and nothing overwrites it either. To take a release deliberately,
# `harness update --force`, or the public installer:
#   curl -fsSL https://harness.autonomous.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
#
# `--no-updates` remains for a stronger promise — no manifest is even fetched. It exports
# ADAPTER_UPDATE_DISABLE=true in the launcher, switching off both the 60s poll and `harness start`'s
# update-before-connect (cli.ts `stageLatestBundle`), which also silences the update check for a
# release-labelled build installed with --no-build.
