# Harness experience improvements · September 21

Branch: `codex/harness-improvements`, starting from `735471a1`.

## Start here

- [Eight hands-on experiences](../docs/hands-on.md), with an
  [interactive local guide](../docs/hands-on.html), original native demo videos and starting prompts.
- [Three runnable starters](../docs/try-hands-on.md) for the physics, music and circuit panes.
  They use this checkout's source with already installed native assets.
- [All 82 packages](HARNESS-INVENTORY-2026-09-21.md): 72 harnesses and 10 shared viewers, including
  the reviewed explanation for each of the 17 structural warnings.

The eight main additions are MuJoCo's alternative futures, Godogen's rewindable playtests,
Blender's named design variants, Strudel's recorded performances, RDKit's bond-energy studies,
Typst/Doc Viewer's anchored revision reviews, Jev Sheets' paired question trials, and CircuitJS's
saved trace comparisons. Each has native runtime evidence and an editable handoff. Nine Jev
viewers also reject decisions from superseded sessions; Video Viewer preserves a captured
frame's identity and earlier saved images. The sections below record implementation and test
boundaries for each change. Jev's provider checks use local practice responses, not paid live calls.

## Product brief

Read the repository README, `docs/ideal-users.md`, the Store authoring guide, and the previous
experience rebuild reviews. Build for the curious engineer who wants to participate in the whole
idea: make, inspect, play, revise, and take the work away. Preserve the user's choices and editable
source. A themed preset or a green technical check alone is not evidence of a compelling product.

The full objective remains to review **every current harness**, prioritize the most promising
experiences, and improve the catalog. This log distinguishes source review, implemented changes,
runtime evidence, and remaining work. No subjective “10×” claim is inferred from tests.

## Review method and priorities

Inventory all package manifests, listing status, templates, viewers, domain instructions, and test
entry points. Review the actual interaction paths in the most promising packages first. Prefer
capabilities that connect immediate curiosity to an original, useful, editable result. Preserve
existing toolchains and authoring workflows; extend the place where people inspect and direct work.

1. **MuJoCo:** branch a real physics state, change the conditions, compare both futures, and retain
   the exact experiment. Existing live simulation is strong; repeatable user-directed comparison
   is the missing interaction. Implemented and verified below.
2. **Godogen / Phaser / Voxel Worlds / Game Master:** play, inspect a particular moment, and turn
   discoveries into precise revisions of an original game or world. Inspect existing version,
   input, and export paths before choosing implementation. Godogen/Game Viewer improvement
   implemented and verified below; the other three received source review in this pass.
3. **Blender / CAD / Generative Art / Creative Direction:** make direct exploration useful to
   the next authored revision; preserve approved versions and deliver usable assets.
4. **Music Studio / Strudel / Score / sound studios:** help people hear, shape and retain a musical
   idea; verify the listening and export paths as well as controls.
5. **Science, data, engineering, media, research, local AI, and unlisted experiments:** finish the
   individual review, prioritize findings by useful first result and ongoing human participation,
   then implement and verify the domain-appropriate improvements.

These are working priorities, not claims that the unreviewed runtime paths are deficient. The
existing `work/SUPERPOWERS.md` and subsequent rebuild reports contain useful historical evidence;
current files and fresh runtime checks decide the next action.

## Verification ledger

- Initial branch and worktree verified clean.
- Manifest/template/viewer/test inventory and structural warning review completed for all 82 packages.
- Native runtime journeys were exercised for the implemented experiences; this is not a cold-install
  or full runtime pass for all 82 packages.
- No installed package, running user session, published catalog, or existing project changed.
- Implementation, actual native measurements, browser checks and remaining limits are recorded below.

## First improvement: MuJoCo's What if lab

Implemented a reusable physics experiment, available on any loaded model:

- Pin a complete integration state from live simulation or a recorded frame. Compare two futures
  from that state with gravity, friction and a timed body force as explicit inputs.
- Overlay the baseline as a wireframe, show both measured paths, scrub one shared timeline, inspect
  height and body separation, and return to the untouched live simulation.
- Preserve current experiments across agent saves. New work appears on return; the previous
  compiled model's source remains available even if an edit on disk becomes invalid.
- Save a self-contained experiment: exact source model and assets, compiled-model patch, full
  integration state, recorded control tape, changes and measured frames. Native Python can
  reproduce the file independently. A CSV contains actual sampled positions and contacts.
- Keep the simulation visible above a bottom panel at 390px; provide keyboard-operable comparison
  controls and actual cancellation. Original sim/replay/actuator controls remain available.
- Agent instructions explain the experiment-to-revision workflow and distinguish held/recorded
  controls from a feedback controller that must be rerun in Python.

Verified so far:

- Six real-WASM experiment tests: analytical free fall, analytical impulse, identical/repeated runs,
  real sliding friction with explicit contact pairs, cancellation/exception cleanup, input bounds
  and the recorded control interpolation contract.
- The full viewer suite passes: 29 tests plus WASM and server install smoke tests.
- Chrome 390px/1280px integration: actual controls and downloads, live-state preservation, deferred
  source changes, playback, cancellation and no page exceptions. Screenshots visually reviewed.
- A real servo-patched Menagerie Go2: 19 model/asset files bundled, 19 generalized positions,
  recorded control tape, 168 measured frames. Its 20 N shove changed maximum body separation by
  1.13 cm. The export reproduced using native MuJoCo 3.13.0 without the original workspace, with
  maximum qpos differences below `2.3e-15`. This is a successful reproduction of that finite
  experiment, not a policy robustness claim.
- The simpler pendulum experiment reproduced natively within `5e-16` metres of the browser.
- All 82 package manifests pass conformance. The README/catalog inventory was corrected from 48
  to the canonical 49 listed harnesses; generated presentation checks pass.

Local evidence is under `/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/` (`mujoco/`,
`robot/`, `catalog-conformance.json`). The robot browser check is opt-in and has reproducible
environment parameters in `test/robot-experiments.browser.mjs`. It reads a scratch rollout and
installed tools; it does not change installed packages, user workspaces or running sessions.

Final source-bundle and keyboard/playback browser checks pass, and the added **Frame both futures**
control and a branch from an arbitrary replay frame were exercised on the real robot. A changed
gravity input correctly fails native reproduction against the saved measurements. The pendulum
export also reproduces without an external
model path. Visual evidence: [robot comparison](../docs/images/mujoco-what-if-robot.png) and
[narrow layout](../docs/images/mujoco-what-if-mobile.png).

No catalog publication or installed app update has been performed.

## Second improvement: rewind, retry, and keep a playtest moment

Reviewed Godogen/Game Viewer, Phaser, Voxel Worlds, and Game Master's current interaction paths.
Voxel Worlds already has direct object/voxel authoring, undo, source conflict handling, and useful
3D exports. Game Master already has authored tabletop rules and deterministic playtest replays.
Phaser retains scene context across edits, but that is not a complete game-state rewind. Game
Viewer's existing version isolation protects an ongoing run; a specific moment within that run
was the most useful missing feedback loop to implement first.

Implemented in Game Viewer and demonstrated by Godogen's Alpine Drift starter:

- **Rewind** the recent run, inspect a recorded frame, return to the exact live moment, or
  **Try from here** with a different move. The studio restores positions, velocity, jumps,
  collected gates, score, timer, and camera, instead of replaying keyboard events.
- **Pin moment** with Keep/Change/Explore feedback, a real canvas image, complete JSON state,
  and a frozen copy of the selected compiled game. Saved moments are ordinary workspace files
  in `out/playtests/` and reopen after later source edits and a complete viewer restart.
- Preserve Explore versus Play separately from game state. An agent build waits while the user
  is inspecting a rewind or writing a note, including in Explore mode.
- An optional, documented snapshot contract works for other games; games without it keep their
  existing controls. Bounded history, explicit state validation, atomic saved folders, original
  build retention, and archive isolation keep the current build verdict truthful.
- The completed run stops filling its history with duplicate finish-screen frames. Resuming
  waits for the game's acknowledgement before handing input back. The first Play frame now
  frames the rider immediately, so even the earliest rewind frame is useful.
- Agent instructions explain how to read moment notes and preserve Keep feedback. The original
  editable project remains the source; archived `game/` folders are compiled builds.

Verified:

- All 13 viewer tests pass, including original readiness/failure/retention/export behavior,
  snapshot bounds and legacy compatibility, rejected-state rollback, terminal-frame retention,
  persistent moments, traversal rejection, and saved-build/current-verdict isolation.
- The original Chrome suite passes all eight checks: keyboard/jump/pause/restart, live builds,
  syntax and runtime failures, version retention, a complete course, standalone export, and
  a narrow layout. TypeScript and both package conformance checks pass.
- Seven new real-browser scenarios pass: gates and score rewind, exact mid-jump return,
  alternate steering after resume, persisted note/image/state/build, saved games after source
  changes and restart, Explore capture across an agent edit, and legacy games. Invalid states
  leave the world unchanged. No uncaught browser exceptions were observed.
- Desktop and 390px screenshots were visually reviewed. The new timing checks exposed and
  corrected the input-resume race; visual review exposed the unusable early camera position.
- A 20-second demonstration was recorded in Chrome using the Apple M2 Max Metal renderer,
  showing play, rewind, a different move, a note, and reopening the saved moment.

Evidence: `/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/game-moments-final/` and
`game-demo/`. The repeatable tests are `store/viewers/game-viewer/test/` and
`store/agents/godogen/test/playtest.e2e.mjs`. These are mechanical and visual checks of the
implemented workflow, not a claim of independent human playtesting or universal game determinism.
Snapshot hooks remain the game's responsibility; screenshots capture the canvas rather than its
HTML overlays, and externally hosted assets still depend on their URLs.

Checked-in evidence: [rewind](../docs/images/godogen-rewind.png),
[pin a moment](../docs/images/godogen-moment.png),
[390px saved moment](../docs/images/godogen-moments-mobile.png), and
[20-second demonstration](../docs/images/godogen-rewind-demo.mp4).

Next: continue the 3D/CAD authoring review, beginning with Blender, Autonomous Workshop, and their
shared viewers. Initial README review confirms Generative Art, Creative Direction, and Music
Studio already have substantial original authoring and export workflows; preserve those rather
than replacing them with cosmetic presets. The full catalog goal remains active.

## Third improvement: shape an authored Blender design and keep its source

Reviewed Blender, the shared 3D Viewer, Autonomous Workshop, FreeCAD, OpenSCAD and text-to-cad.
The CAD wrappers already emphasize editable native source, measured checks and useful exports;
Autonomous Workshop's upstream workflow adds an explicit physical-part critique. The generic
3D Viewer has strong inspection tools, but changing a Blender model previously always required
another agent turn. This made direct exploration of an original design the most useful addition.

Implemented **Shape Lab**, an optional protocol for any authored Blender scene:

- The scene declares its own numeric, integer, boolean and choice controls with `parameters()`.
  The values drive actual Python geometry and materials. The mug starter demonstrates the API;
  a separately authored ribbon lampshade proves the viewer has no mug-specific controls.
- Changing a control runs native Blender on a snapshot of explicitly declared source and assets.
  Material shading reveals finish choices; a changed model is fitted into the view while keeping
  its viewing direction. Existing measure, section, shading and orbit tools remain available.
- **Keep** preserves the exact source, helper modules/license, parameter values, measured glTF,
  report, canvas thumbnail, standalone rebuild script and project ZIP in `out/designs/`.
  Named directions reopen after source changes and after a viewer restart.
- **Use values on next build** writes only `design-values.json`, after matching source hashes.
  The next agent build reads the selected values and produces its normal exports and verdict.
  Main exports wait while the user is exploring; closing the lab returns to the latest one.
- Source and chosen-value revisions are distinct: revisiting a kept direction stays editable
  when only the current choice changed. An incompatible source requires reloading controls or
  having the agent adapt the older direction.
- One native worker and one replaceable queued request, bounded inputs/artifacts, failed-build
  recovery, cancellation and process-group cleanup. Snapshot/archive paths reject escaping links.
  HTTP writes require the page token and same-origin requests. Relative output isolation is a
  project convention, not a security sandbox for arbitrary Python.

Verified:

- All 33 model-viewer tests pass, including the original server/lifecycle/script checks and new
  snapshot, queue replacement, timeout/descendant cleanup, cancellation, archive persistence,
  revision checks, path confinement and write authorization cases.
- All 63 existing Blender tests pass with native bpy, including real small renders, glTF/STL
  exports and turntables. Four new parameter tests pass without bpy.
- Seven actual Chrome/native-Blender workflows pass with no browser errors: controlled geometry
  and material, independent ZIP verification and rebuild, saved directions and explicit values,
  deferred agent exports, persistence across restart, changed-source/failure recovery, and a
  different authored scene with a declared JSON asset.
- The 75 × 75 × 145 mm tumbler rebuilt from its downloaded ZIP in another directory with matching
  object names, measured dimensions, vertices, faces and material names. Original model and
  report hashes stayed unchanged until the test deliberately ran a new main build.
- The lampshade's 32 ribbons and foot produced 33 native mesh objects, 4,992 vertices and 4,834
  faces at 135.2 × 135.2 × 328.02 mm. Its ribbon count, twist and finish come from its source.
- Desktop and 390px screenshots were visually reviewed on Chrome's Apple M2 Max Metal renderer.
  Review fixed cropped tall variants, invalid timestamp display and transient change highlights
  in kept thumbnails. Source synchronization and late-created workspaces also have regression
  coverage. Both package conformance checks and generated catalog checks pass.

Evidence is in `/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/blender-final/` and
`blender-demo/`. The repeatable native check is
`store/viewers/model-viewer/test/shape-lab-browser.mjs`. These checks establish the implemented
author/explore/keep/rebuild loop; they are not independent user research or an assertion that
every authored scene supports interactive build speeds. Additional source dependencies still
need to be installed, and expensive/custom render paths may need a geometry-only preview path.

The recorded lamp session keeps two different directions and reopens one; native preview builds
for the two kept designs took 0.518 and 0.578 seconds on this machine. Checked-in evidence:
[design shelf](../docs/images/blender-shape-lab.png),
[390px controls](../docs/images/blender-shape-lab-mobile.png), and
[native interaction recording](../docs/images/blender-shape-lab-demo.mp4).

The full catalog review and improvement goal remains active. No installed harness, user session,
store publication or main-worktree content was changed by this feature.

## Fourth improvement: keep an actual live Strudel performance

Reviewed Music Studio, Score, Generative Art, Creative Direction, Strudel, AbletonAI, JUCE Agent
Toolkit, Drone Pilot, Autonomous Circuit, CircuitJS, Manim, Remotion, OpenMontage, and their
relevant shared viewers. This round examined their source and authoring/export instructions;
only Strudel received new native runtime acceptance work in this round. Music Studio and Score
already support substantial original composition and useful source/audio exports. Fieldwork,
Forme and Vector already have real editable artifacts and portable handoffs. Preserve those.
The upstream media and PCB pipelines remain intact. AbletonAI's optional Live bridge is read-only;
its starter and JUCE's starter should not be described as complete native DAW/plugin workflows.

Strudel has a different strength: performing an authored program while it plays. The pane already
had live code, voice lanes, mute and solo, but no way to keep the actual performance. Added:

- **Record take → Finish take → Keep take** captures the real Superdough stereo output through
  an AudioWorklet. The recording branch emits silence, preserving the existing speaker route.
  Float WAV preserves the engine's samples, with no normalization or clipping.
- During performance, mix requests, successful code versions, cycle/tempo and named moments
  are journaled on the audio clock. A failed evaluation keeps the last successful source in the
  journal. Markers seek the saved audio; a stereo waveform displays the captured channels.
- A named take keeps WAV, source versions/hashes, measured audio properties, journal, README
  and a portable ZIP in `out/takes/`. Saved takes reopen after source changes and server restart.
  Playback stops the live instrument; restarting the instrument pauses playback.
- Incoming agent source waits during recording and while pane edits are unsaved. Loading the
  latest file is explicit. Reconnecting the event stream checks missed file changes too, and
  stale fetch responses cannot overwrite a newer one. Saved sources do not enter the live picker.
- Failed saves preserve the browser's take and WAV download. A capture identity makes a retry
  after a lost save acknowledgement idempotent. A restarted server's token refreshes without
  reloading the tab. Server writes are validated, bounded, token/origin protected and atomic;
  escaping symlinks are rejected. Audio files support range requests for native playback/seek.
- Capture is bounded to 120 seconds or six million frames. Transport stop, context suspension
  and output replacement finish capture. Interruption keeps complete chunks received so far;
  unsaved audio is held in the current tab. Journal limits are documented, and source is available
  for continued agent authoring without overwriting the original take.

Verified:

- All 24 Node tests and 51 existing Python tests pass. New checks cover exact sample/chunk
  boundaries, independent WAV properties, journal validation, write authentication, failed writes,
  path confinement, archive isolation, range serving and independent Python ZIP integrity.
- Seven real Chrome workflows use the installed, unmodified `@strudel/repl` and actual Web Audio:
  performance/mix/code/markers, native playback/seek, restart/mobile, failed evaluation plus lost
  save acknowledgement/restart retry, interrupted audio, deferred edits, and full-length capture.
  No browser page errors. Remote sample maps are empty in this offline synth test; DSP is real.
- Independent FFT/RMS analysis of a two-voice diagnostic found 220/440 Hz initially; muting the
  left voice reduced its RMS below 1e-6 while the right voice stayed at 0.0724. A code change
  produced the expected C4/E5 tones (262/660 Hz FFT bins at this analysis resolution).
- The full-length take ends at exactly 5,760,000 stereo frames: 120.000 seconds at 48 kHz.
  Its WAV is 46,080,056 bytes. FFprobe independently identifies stereo `pcm_f32le`; Python
  verifies the ZIP and the captured WAV hash. This exercises the largest normal upload too.
- A separately authored five-voice synth piece, **Lantern room**, was performed with four
  markers and two code versions, then kept and reopened at 390px. It captures 18.907 seconds,
  with peak 0.959 and RMS 0.0953. These are signal checks, not a claim of subjective listening
  quality. Desktop/mobile visual review fixed lane sizing when opening the recorder and made
  mobile voice names legible. Package conformance and generated catalog checks pass.

The repeatable browser check is `store/agents/strudel/test/performance-browser.mjs`; use
`LONG_CAPTURE=1` to include the two-minute test. Evidence and preserved workspaces are in
`/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/strudel-final/` and `strudel-demo/`.
Checked-in evidence: [desktop](../docs/images/strudel-live-take.png),
[mobile](../docs/images/strudel-live-take-mobile.png), and
[performance walkthrough](../docs/images/strudel-live-take-demo.mp4). The MP4 pairs the screen
recording with the saved WAV, using AAC and approximate visual/audio alignment; the original
float WAV and source bundle remain in the evidence workspace.

The WAV is the captured performance. Scheduler lookahead, effect tails, random patterns and
external dependencies mean the journal is not a deterministic replay. Other applications, system
volume and external MIDI instruments are outside this recorder. Browser acceptance was on Chrome;
a 390px viewport is a layout check, not a claim of testing mobile Safari or every audio device.

The full catalog review and improvement goal remains active. All implementation, demo artifacts
and tests stayed in the improvement worktree and disposable evidence directories.

## Science and engineering review, then RDKit bond studies

Reviewed the science/data packages and the shared Studio Viewer bridges, with selected source paths
and authoring contracts checked in addition to their READMEs. This is source review unless native
verification is listed below:

- **Data Studio** already supports original CSV input, SQLite joins and queries, traceable source,
  browser recomputation and a portable report/database/source bundle. **Lab Bench** already supports
  authored experimental designs, editable protocols, real observations, fit diagnostics and separate
  confirmation runs with frozen forecasts. Preserve those complete loops.
- **marimo** uses the upstream reactive notebook editor and runner; it can author arbitrary Python
  notebooks. **Quantum Studio** is an unlisted 1–8-qubit statevector editor; **GIS** is an unlisted,
  bounded local GeoJSON explorer. Their existing interactive capabilities and limits matter more
  than adding a new preset chooser.
- Reviewed **autoresearch-mlx**, **Foam-Agent**, **SimSkill**, **DimOS**, **Comfy MCP** and **Bonsai MCP**
  with the shared **Studio Viewer**. Several bridges have useful native paths but narrow starter
  models: the four-way SUMO intersection, coarse 2D LBM flow and office navigation are not arbitrary
  general simulators. The CPU character-transition experiment is not an MLX transformer training
  run, and the procedural SVG path is not diffusion image generation. Preserve those distinctions;
  this review does not claim native acceptance of every optional runtime. Foam-Agent and SimSkill
  are not installed in this environment.
- Reviewed the **Home Assistant**, **KiCad**, **Yosys** and **Orca Slicer** package contracts. Home
  Assistant's actual Core automation tests and trace export, and Orca's native slicing and portable
  rerun files, are substantial existing workflows. Avoid replacing those with superficial demos.

Selected **RDKit** next: its existing viewer exposes conformers and measurements, but a person
could not directly turn a chosen bond into a computed experiment and a reusable result.

Implemented:

- A native **Bond scan** from the current 3D conformer. Choose an eligible chain or pick four atoms
  directly in 2D/3D and use the measured dihedral. The unmodified RDKit rotates a non-ring single
  bond and computes MMFF94 energy at 13, 25 or 37 angles. This is a rigid scan, with the other
  internal coordinates fixed; the UI and exports say so explicitly.
- Drag the energy curve or scrub its keyboard-accessible slider to inspect the actual calculated
  3D coordinates. Play the scan, jump to its lowest sampled point and overlay the starting pose.
  Invalid chains, rings, missing hydrogens or unavailable force-field parameters leave the last
  valid study available. Scans accept one connected 3D MOL/SDF molecule with 4–200 explicit atoms;
  no model templates or synthetic energies substitute for the input molecule.
- **Keep study** preserves a title, note, exact input conformer, selected SDF, every pose, energy
  CSV and full-precision coordinates in `out/torsions/<id>/`. The server recomputes and checks the
  calculation fingerprint before publishing an atomic save. Its ZIP includes a standalone Python
  reproducer, calculation source and license. The original molecule stays unchanged.
- Studies reopen after changes, server restart or removal of the original molecule. Incoming agent
  output waits while an experiment is open; returning loads the revised source. Failed saves retain
  the current browser study for retry, including refreshing a restarted server's token. Write
  endpoints require the pane token and same origin, bound request sizes, and reject escaping output
  symlinks. Incomplete saves are not published in the study library. Kept structures do not enter
  the live molecule picker or the verdict's newest-artifact search. Pose controls are locked while
  saving the selected point.
- Updated the package description, README and authoring guidance so an agent can continue from the
  user's chosen SDF and note while preserving the original study. Added an authored butane and
  phenethyl-acetate example script; the calculation accepts other compatible molecules too.

Verified:

- 27 Node checks pass, covering existing viewer behavior, atomic persistence, native failure
  cleanup, concurrent request rejection, symlink boundaries, token/origin checks and both declared
  and chunked upload bounds. Native chemistry checks validate independently reconstructed MMFF94
  energies, bond-length preservation, measured angles, periodic endpoints, V3000 input, rejected
  rings/multiple bonds and a stale calculation fingerprint that writes nothing.
- All 138 Python checks passed across the full suite and targeted follow-ups. The two optional
  native setup/initialization checks were run separately with `RDKIT_PYTHON` enabled; the final
  verdict test also confirms a saved scan cannot become the live artifact.
- Seven real Chrome workflows use RDKit 2026.03.6 and unmodified 3Dmol 2.5.5: curve/play/ghost/save;
  deferred changes; failed-save/restart retry; saved/mobile reopen; an independently authored
  aromatic ester; real four-atom picking and ring rejection; and a library with no original files.
  No browser page errors. Screenshots were visually checked at 1280×960 and 390×844; these are
  Chrome layout checks, not a claim of testing every mobile browser.
- A downloaded/extracted study recomputes in a separate directory using only its bundled source
  and RDKit. Maximum energy difference is **0 kcal/mol** and coordinate difference is **0 Å** in
  the tested environment. Displayed MOL coordinates agree with calculation coordinates within
  **0.000047 Å**, the expected four-decimal MOL rounding; full precision remains in JSON.
- The separately recorded walkthrough uses an authored ester, turns its chosen chain through the
  energy curve, and keeps a 60° pose with a note. The portable study and raw video remain under
  `/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/rdkit-demo/`; the repeatable acceptance
  script and JSON results are under `store/agents/rdkit/test/torsion-browser.mjs` and the evidence
  `rdkit-final/` directory. Package conformance and generated catalog checks pass.

Evidence: [desktop](../docs/images/rdkit-bond-scan.png),
[mobile](../docs/images/rdkit-bond-scan-mobile.png), and
[16.84-second native walkthrough](../docs/images/rdkit-bond-scan-demo.mp4).

Scientific limits: compare relative energies only within the same rigid scan. These are not relaxed
barriers, free energies, solution populations, kinetics or activity predictions. Unsaved studies
live in the current tab; a reload discards them. No installed package or existing user molecule was
changed. The full catalog goal remains active; remaining detailed review includes productivity,
research/browser, monitoring, local AI and the unlisted Jev experiments.

## Sixth improvement: keep a document review attached to its actual draft

Expanded the source review across productivity, research, monitoring and local AI before choosing
the shared Doc Viewer:

- **Marp** already combines arbitrary Markdown authoring, native Marp exports, slide notes,
  presenter timing, filmstrip/grid navigation and live changed-slide feedback. **Typst** and
  **Doc Viewer** already have native compilation, genuine pdf.js search/selection/outline/zoom,
  stable reader position across recompiles and useful compiler diagnostics. Those paths remain.
- **Sheet & Docs Studio** coordinates native DOCX, formula-driven XLSX and LibreOffice PDF output
  from an editable shared source. Its generic literal table and regional-comparison schema are
  bounded; it does not implement arbitrary spreadsheet formulas or PPTX. The shared PDF review
  improvement now applies to it too.
- **Jev Sheets** has row-plus-context classification, per-cell distributions, confidence filtering,
  file import, original-column CSV export and source attribution. **Jev Browser** has an actual
  Chrome crawler and source selection. **Roundtable** preserves a motion, separate model responses,
  a moderator's claim map and exports. These received source/README review here, not fresh paid
  API calls, a panel run or a claim that every judgment is correct.
- **Harness Monitor** uses daemon, process, tmux and transcript observations with guarded runtime
  controls. **Machine Monitor** exposes paired-machine observations with explicit stale/unknown
  states. **Grid** reuses CLI-backed workers. **Ollama, MLX-LM and vLLM** have native local-runtime,
  model and job paths, with a shared implementation for the local AI packages. No actual user
  workers, remote machines, downloaded models or monitoring controls were changed in this review.
- Read the complete README contracts of all 17 unlisted **Jev experiments**. Archer/Catcher/Slalom
  are synthetic tracking/intercept problems; Arena supplies path counts to the decision model;
  Duel's rules engine supplies legal Reversi moves; Blocks models decision time against the fall;
  FPS is an independently authored software-raycast arena; Lander/Pendulum/Pong are toy control
  loops. Conductor's notes become browser audio; Compactor can analyze a bounded imported transcript
  without changing its live session; Firehose can triage a user's bounded data file and export CSV.
  Launcher launches only on paper; Shopper and Trader use synthetic prices; Guard is a demo,
  not a security boundary. Their reported mock measurements and earlier live-model samples were
  read as historical evidence, not rerun or promoted into new performance claims. Further detailed
  implementation review of these experiments remains, especially preserving useful decisions
  beyond transient controls. They remain unlisted.
- **Firmware Studio** compiles through PlatformIO and reports native memory/build output without
  claiming device verification. **Godot Studio** retains native Godot export and arbitrary source
  authoring. **Web Studio** retains arbitrary web authoring and an original interactive starter.

The selected gap: someone could read an excellent live PDF, but their judgment was not anchored
to the exact draft they had read. Added **Review → Hold this draft**:

- Capture the already parsed PDF's actual bytes, not whatever may have just overwritten the file.
  Select native PDF text, drag a page region, or leave a page note. Label it **Change**, **Keep** or
  **Question**. Numbered pins reopen and reveal the corresponding feedback. Area picking supports
  pointer cancellation and Escape; ordinary button activation works from the keyboard.
- Keep a title, quoted text, page numbers and normalized rectangles with the exact PDF and SHA-256.
  Each immutable `.harness/doc-reviews/<id>/` packet has `reference.pdf`, `review.md`, `review.json`
  and a portable ZIP with an explanation. It does not rewrite the source or embed PDF annotations.
  Editable source and assets stay in the workspace, as the UI documentation and archive explain.
- Agent recompiles wait while the review is held. **Compare latest** opens the actual latest PDF;
  quoted notes locate exact normalized wording across changed pagination. A missing or repeated
  quotation is reported explicitly. Page/area anchors always describe the old PDF. Returning to
  the reviewed draft restores its bytes and highlights; **Back to live** resumes workspace output.
- Native PDF download and browser printing use the displayed bytes. In-flight live loads cannot
  replace a held draft. A delayed reader-position callback was fixed when returning to an empty
  workspace, and empty workspaces can still reopen their kept reviews.
- Saves publish atomically with strict metadata, coordinate, PDF signature/hash and size checks;
  the browser's native pdf.js parses the document. Server validation is not a second full PDF
  parser. Write requests require a per-process page token, same Origin and loopback Host. Uploads
  are bounded even without Content-Length; archive paths reject symlinks. A failed save retains
  browser notes, a lost acknowledgement retries the same ID, and a restarted server refreshes its
  token without discarding the draft. Unsaved work survives Back to live but not a tab reload.
- Reviews support 30 MB / 500 pages, 100 notes and 2,000 characters per note. Narrow windows put
  the PDF above a scrollable review panel. Typst and Sheet & Docs Studio guidance now teaches the
  agent how to read the packet and revise the original source while preserving the review.

Verified:

- **83 Node checks** pass: existing reader/server/workspace/shell behavior plus packet identity,
  byte preservation, independent ZIP extraction, immutable retry, failure cleanup, symlink bounds,
  token/Host/Origin checks, declared/chunked upload bounds and interrupted requests. Archived PDFs
  cannot become the live artifact. **15 Typst checks** pass with the native compiler enabled.
- **Nine native Chrome journeys** pass with no page errors. They cover actual mouse text selection,
  rectangle/page notes, pin navigation and Escape; browser ZIP and displayed-PDF downloads;
  deferred updates; a quote moving from page 1 to page 2; missing and ambiguous wording;
  lost-acknowledgement retry and process restart; removal of the original PDF; 390 px layout and
  scaled highlights; unsaved-draft return and deliberate discard; a pending-load race; and a real
  failed native compile followed by recovery. The core nine journeys were also run with the forced
  legacy pdf.js build. This is Chrome verification, not independent Safari/iOS/WKWebView testing.
- Authored a fictional portable-light brief in Typst, compiled the three-page original and four-page
  revision with **Typst 0.15.1**, rendered all seven pages with Poppler and visually inspected them.
  The downloaded review ZIP was read independently with Python's `zipfile`: the stored PDF SHA-256
  matched the exact original and all four notes were present. The original editable source remains
  editable and is not limited to this fixture.
- Visually checked desktop, narrow layout and revision-comparison screenshots. Recorded a paced
  **13.72-second native walkthrough**, H.264 1280×960, from actual pointer interactions and native
  recompilation. No simulated PDF renderer or generated screenshots. The three affected packages
  pass conformance; generated presentation metadata and the 59-entry catalog validate.

The full catalog objective remains active. No installed harness, original user workspace, paid
model account, remote service or published catalog was modified. Remaining work includes deeper
implementation review of the unlisted experiments and selecting the next high-value interaction.

## Seventh improvement: compare a question before asking the whole sheet

Reviewed Jev Sheets' native client, row/context construction, header grammar, cache identity,
source-file handling, in-pane edits, existing file chooser/export and tests. Also inspected the CAD
Viewer contract: its pinned upstream viewer already has native measurement, section planes,
explosion and rendering controls, so replacing those controls would not address a missing workflow.

Jev Sheets already advised an agent to test wording on ten hard rows, but this required writing a
one-off script. Added **Question Lab**, directly beside the sheet controls:

- Preview 10/20/40 rows selected from low confidence plus a spread, a spread alone, or the current
  sorted/filtered view. Pin a selected sheet row. Freeze the actual row text, metadata and context;
  exclude sample truth labels and group labels from the model input.
- Write any supported yes/no, choice or score header. Re-ask both versions together using the same
  native client and shared question builder, one paired call per frozen row, with four in flight.
  Read full probability distributions and exact wire questions. Filter changed labels, record a
  human preference and write a note without turning that preference into a truth label.
- Keep an immutable `.harness/question-trials/<id>/` packet with the exact sample, question wire
  payloads, raw answers, returned provider/model/usage, human notes, CSV, readable review, reusable
  sample `sheet.json`, candidate `column.json`, file checksums and a portable ZIP. Kept packets
  reopen after viewer restart or source deletion. They include sampled data, never credentials.
- Try the candidate across the whole sheet as a separate column. Reuse the trial rows only when
  context/data and the currently connected route/requested model match. Preserve the original
  column; reject a changed source/context/question. As with existing pane-added columns, the
  extra column is runtime state. Updated guidance tells the agent to retain an accepted header in
  the original `sheet.json`, never replace the original dataset with the trial's small sample.
- Trials are bounded to 40 rows, 4,000-character headers, a 512 KB preview, 24 KB per paired result,
  2 MB result JSON, eight open trials and 100 kept trials. Cancellation stops scheduling; in-flight
  calls may finish using the client's normal transient-error retries. Authentication/credit errors
  stop further rows after the in-flight batch. Failed/cancelled packets retain their status.
- New commands require a per-process page token on the existing loopback/Origin-guarded server.
  Archives reject symlink directories/files, stage writes atomically, validate result checksums on
  reopening and clean up failed saves. Start, keep and apply tolerate lost acknowledgements without
  duplicating a trial, archive or column. A restarted server refreshes the page token.
- A real browser sequence caught a note being overwritten when the result filter changed during
  its save. Separate note drafts and partial note/preference updates now preserve typing across
  polling and filtering; the selected preference also updates while the note retains focus.

Verified **57 package checks**, including the existing sheet/import/Excel/counting behavior, sample
selection, frozen context, result validation, cancellation, partial failures, note/preference
updates, archive integrity/immutability, write-failure retry, path/token checks, cached whole-sheet
application and staleness. A local HTTP protocol fixture uses the production Jev client with an
explicit dummy key and isolated empty credential file: it verifies actual paired requests and
returned probabilities/model/usage without calling an external provider.

**Seven native Chrome journeys** pass with no page errors: import the original fictional CSV,
select/pin a real sheet cell, compare, filter and review; retain a note while switching filters;
retry a lost keep response and independently extract/check the downloaded ZIP with Python;
apply without duplicating the column; reject stale data while retaining the frozen preview;
recover a lost start response without a second trial; restart the server, refresh the token and
reopen after deleting the source; and use the 390px layout, Escape and reopening. These native
browser runs explicitly use the offline client. They do **not** establish live Jev accuracy,
latency, calibration or superiority of one wording. The UI, packet and guidance say so.

Visually checked the desktop preview, reviewed comparison and narrow view. Recorded and inspected
a separate paced **12.84-second H.264 walkthrough**, 1440×1040, from actual browser interactions.
Package conformance and the doctor pass; shared Jev kit copies remain unchanged and in sync.

[frozen preview](../docs/images/question-lab-preview.png),
[narrow layout](../docs/images/question-lab-mobile.png),

The full catalog objective remains active. Continue the detailed source review of the unlisted
experiments, then prioritize the next interaction or correctness gap supported by that evidence.

## Eighth improvement — CircuitJS Scope Lab

Reviewed the full native JavaScript interface and the existing CircuitJS wrapper. Also revisited
Video Viewer, Manim, Generative Art/Web Viewer, Yosys and Home Assistant: those already expose
substantial native timeline, seed, waveform, hardware-flow and scenario controls. CircuitJS had
excellent live manipulation but no durable comparison between the circuits a person actually tried.

Added **Scope Lab** with up to eight named-node/component voltage/current probes, 1 ms–5 s windows,
reference overlays, two measured cursors, cursor zoom, keyboard sample stepping, notes and a saved
capture shelf. It snapshots the visible simulator's exact export, including in-pane edits, then
runs a separate real CircuitJS instance. Only display/iteration pacing changes; the actual solver
still supplies every observation through `ontimestep`. The visible circuit, run state and source
file are untouched. Source edits during capture cannot change the isolated experiment.

Each immutable `.harness/circuit-captures/<id>/` includes the original native export, the isolated
instance's native export, all stored timestamped measurements in CSV/JSON, sampled statistics,
standalone SVG, notes, runtime source/build fingerprints, file checksums and a downloadable ZIP.
Source/build metadata at capture and save are kept separately. Original circuits and kept takes
remain available after source deletion and restart. Save retries recover lost responses without
creating another packet; a server restart refreshes the write token. Unsaved takes can be discarded.

This is explicitly a new simulation, not a full checkpoint of every internal solver state. Native
imports can produce different transients. Comparison follows node names or component type/index.
RMS/mean use trapezoidal weighting of stored samples, and can miss fast signals or narrow spikes.
The UI and packet keep these limits visible. Native XML stays in the packet; agent instructions
continue to require the editable plaintext workspace format. Limits bound probes, elements,
circuit bytes, samples, callbacks, wall time, request bytes, open takes and kept packets. Partial
captures retain their actual reason. Token/Origin/Host checks protect writes; real workspace
folders, staged publication, symlink rejection and content/ZIP checksums protect stored evidence.

Verification:

- **30 Node checks** pass, including the original viewer/server behavior plus pacing preservation,
  solver sampling, adaptive timestep handling, between-sample clock reversal, stopping, non-finite
  probes, time-weighted statistics, cursor lookup, comparison identity, source immutability,
  idempotent keep, corrupt packets/ZIPs, failed-write cleanup, symlinks and bounded HTTP requests.
  An existing missing-workspace regression caught an eager `realpath` startup failure; the viewer
  again starts and serves its waiting pane when the workspace is absent.
- **54 Python checks** pass for the real format judge, setup fixtures, doctor, initialization and
  viewer launcher. Package conformance, the installed native-runtime doctor and catalog
  presentation checks pass.
- **Eight native Chrome journeys** pass with no page errors. An original RC fixture uses the real
  100 Hz sine source, 1 µF capacitor and 1/2 kΩ resistors. Measured steady-state gains were about
  0.8466 and 0.6225, versus independent analytic 0.846733 and 0.622677. Resistor current agrees
  with `(Vin−Vout)/R` to the checked tolerance (the first run's maximum difference was zero).
  A 500 ms capture recorded 100,001 native solver callbacks in about 1.6 seconds in the isolated
  single-browser run, while the paused visible circuit's clock and export were exactly unchanged.
- The unchanged 555 starter, a different topology without labeled nodes, captures timing-capacitor
  voltage and an output swinging from approximately 0 to 9.98 V. The native sequence also checks
  source changes during a running capture, stopped partial traces, exact in-pane edits, reference
  selection, zoom, keyboard cursors, lost acknowledgements, restart, discard, deleted source,
  readonly saved notes, phone layout and Escape. Downloaded ZIP CRCs and every SHA-256 checksum were
  independently checked with Python; CSV numeric values equal JSON sample values exactly.
- Visually checked desktop, zoom, timer and narrow layouts. Corrected clipped right-axis labels and
  snapped cursor markers to the actual measured sample, including the endpoints after zoom.
  Recorded a separate paced **13.48-second H.264 walkthrough**, 1440×1040, from actual native
  browser interactions, with no page errors.

exact ZIPs, test logs and the recording script are under
`/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/scope-lab*`.

The remaining review is examining delayed model answers in older unlisted Jev experiments. Source
inspection suggests reset/configuration races in some loops; reproduce them before changing the
behavior. Compactor and Firehose already carry session/batch revisions, and Launcher/Guard already
serialize substantial parts of their decision flow. These are source findings, not new live-model
performance claims.

## Ninth improvement — keep Jev decisions attached to the session they read

Finished the deeper driver review of the 17 unlisted Jev experiments. The control-loop games use
real local simulation rules, while Launcher remains an explicitly simulated command palette,
Trader a synthetic paper market, Shopper a synthetic price board and Conductor a typed-decision
music loop. Compactor's own-transcript path preserves messages, supports pins and writes an
analysis plan without changing a live session; Firehose's own-data path writes row results and
uses batch revisions. Guard reads real project diffs and runs the local project's test command,
but its model judgment is not proof that a change is safe. None was relisted or represented as a
newly verified live-model benchmark. Existing queue/session guards in Archer, Catcher, Slalom,
Blocks, Launcher, Compactor and Firehose informed the focused fixes below.

Reproduced **nine reset failures** through the actual viewer servers and production Jev clients,
using a held local HTTP response, an explicit dummy key and an isolated credential path. Trader,
Shopper, Arena and FPS applied an old answer to the replacement simulation; Duel added an old
referee result to the new board; Conductor restored an obsolete bar after reset. Lander, Pendulum
and Pong cleared their decision counters before waiting for the old queued answer, so a fresh
reset still reported a completed decision. All nine original reproductions failed for the observed
state/counter mismatch before the fixes.

- Results and errors now verify the world/board/revision they belong to before being applied.
  Fresh simulations clear the displayed decision and old error as appropriate.
- Resets invalidate the rest of an old manual batch. Queued physics resets clear counters after
  old work settles; watched workspace replacements invalidate pending results too.
- Conductor queues complete bar work, snapshots the audience request across harmony and notes,
  skips an obsolete notes call, and makes the newest request produce two fresh bars. A reset
  again returns two consistently numbered initial bars. Duel queues rethinking so a reset or
  changed board still gets its first valid move, instead of silently losing that work to `busy`.
- Existing model telemetry remains a record of calls that actually happened. This does not abort
  an already sent provider request or claim to undo its cost.

**28 delayed-protocol checks** now pass: each of the nine experiments survives a late success and
late failure across reset, stops the old three-step batch, runs again, and handles a watched source
edit while an answer is pending. A separate overlapping-audience test verifies two fresh bars for
the newest mood request and no obsolete second-stage notes call. **All 123 existing tests** for
these nine packages also pass in explicit offline mode. Shared Jev kit copies remain unchanged
and in sync. Added reusable session-lifecycle guidance to the kit README.

Repeatable test: `store/tools/jev-kit/test/async-sessions.test.mjs`. Before/after logs and the original
package results are in `/private/tmp/openharness-harness-improvements-evidence/jev-async-*.txt`
and `jev-existing-tests.txt`. These checks verify real wrapper/client protocol behavior using
local fixture answers; they do not establish live Jev speed, judgment or calibration.

## Tenth improvement: a field guide for getting hands-on

The new experiences now have a common entry point: [the readable field guide](../docs/hands-on.md)
and its [interactive local version](../docs/hands-on.html). Both are generated from the same
reviewed `store/hands-on.json`. The guide starts with the user's craft and intended action:
change a world, shape a design, retry a moment, perform music, inspect a molecular bond, review a
PDF, refine a question, or compare a signal. Each has a real native screenshot and recording,
a starting prompt, three concrete interactions, the artifact it keeps and a follow-up prompt that
carries the user's judgment back into the agent's next revision.

The videos show separately authored projects; suggested prompts are not presented as the prompts
that produced those recordings. Jev Sheets remains prominently identified as offline practice
with fictional data. Provider requirements and the important limits of open-loop physics, rigid
bond scans, PDF anchors, compiled games and native circuit captures stay beside their experience.

The browser guide opens directly from disk. It has no framework, analytics, remote dependencies
or service. Craft links preserve ordinary linking and browser history; a next-craft action puts
keyboard focus into the visible experience. Videos load only on an explicit play action and
pause when hidden. Prompt text stays fully visible in narrow panes; clipboard failure selects
it and gives a truthful manual-copy instruction. Without JavaScript, all eight articles, prompts,
images and direct video links remain readable. The generated Markdown gives GitHub readers the
same instructions without needing to open an HTML file.

The root README links to the guide outside its generated inventory block. Eight Store packages
now include the same starting prompts; seven generic upstream taglines were rewritten around the
actual hands-on workflow. Existing screenshot/prompt pairs remain first. The previous Jev Sheets
Question Lab example was moved behind its original illustrated example because the Store's
browse surface independently selects the first available image.

Verification:

- 63 browser checks passed against the final HTML opened directly from disk: all eight craft
  destinations and exact prompts, all eight real MP4s decoding, deep links and Back, keyboard
  navigation, native clipboard contents and denied-clipboard selection, no remote requests,
  no early video downloads, hidden-video pause, complete prompt visibility and no horizontal
  overflow at 390 and 320 pixels, and the JavaScript-free fallback. No page exceptions.
- Desktop, Jev and narrow screenshots were visually inspected. Evidence:
  `hands-on/` and `hands-on-browser-final.txt` under the local evidence root.
- `node store/tools/hands-on.mjs --check` verifies generated content, all local asset paths and
  matching Store prompts. The 49-harness/10-viewer presentation and 59-entry published-catalog
  schema checks pass. The catalog was validated locally, not published.
- Added an actual Go2 MuJoCo recording: a 100 N force for 0.15 seconds, three seconds of native
  simulation, 19 bundled source/model assets and 168 stored frames. Greatest separation is
  6.586 cm; final separation is 0.786 cm. The downloaded packet reproduces under native MuJoCo
  3.13.0 without its original workspace, with max qpos error below `2.8e-15`. The 13.72-second,
  1440×1040 H.264 video and a native screenshot are committed. Evidence: `mujoco-shove-demo/`.

Finished classifying all 17 first-pass structural warnings by their actual setup, initialization,
instruction and artifact-routing contracts. The [inventory](HARNESS-INVENTORY-2026-09-21.md)
records why each warning occurs and the verification boundary. They were not suppressed or
misrepresented as cold-install/native-runtime passes. Eight setup-created paths were also found
in the separately installed Circuit, Workshop, Godogen and Remotion packages; KiCad's cold setup
and the OpenMontage production pipeline were not rerun for that structural review.

## Eleventh improvement: inspect the physics behind a measurement

Recording the robot walkthrough exposed a useful missing interaction: the lab reported the
largest separation but left the user to search for its frame. The **Farthest apart** measurement
is now a button that pauses both native worlds at the first stored frame with that maximum.
**Apart at the finish** similarly jumps to the final moment. Saved experiment metrics include
`maxSeparationFrame` and the actual `maxSeparationTime`, so an agent can locate the same observation.
The wording explicitly describes sampled frames, not a continuous-time extremum search.

A shared seek path also fixes a real return-to-comparison error: preview initialization used to
reset the slider before reading the user's requested value, so scrubbing a retained comparison
after returning live could jump back to zero. The requested frame is now captured before preview
initialization, then both real MuJoCo data instances are positioned there without changing the
live simulation.

- All 29 viewer tests and its native WASM/server smoke checks pass. The analytical freefall check
  now verifies the maximum is at its final sampled time; an identical-world comparison verifies
  the first frame wins a zero-valued tie.
- Twelve native browser journey checks pass, including keyboard activation of the maximum,
  exact qpos for both displayed native poses, unchanged live state, the final-frame jump and
  a nonzero seek after returning to the simulation. Existing downloads, deferred edits, narrow
  layout and cancellation remain verified.
- The refreshed Go2 recording shows the 6.586 cm maximum at its actual 0.252 s sample (frame 14),
  then playback and portable exports. The new packet again reproduces with native MuJoCo.
  Its 14.04-second H.264 video and native screenshot replace the previous guide demo; the guide
  now describes the direct jump. Both controls and the timeline were visually inspected together.

Evidence: `mujoco-peak-tests.txt`, `mujoco-peak-browser.txt`, `mujoco-peak/` and
`mujoco-peak-demo/` under the local evidence root.

## Twelfth improvement: keep the video frame the user actually chose

A final review of Video Viewer found two concrete handoff failures. `Save frame` captured its
pixels before PNG encoding but built the filename afterward, using whatever render and frame
were then current. Opening Beta while Alpha's encoder finished saved Alpha's pixels with Beta's
name. Different renders saved at the same scene/quality/frame path also silently replaced the
older PNG. Both were reproduced with two original, native Manim scenes before changing the code.

The viewer now captures pixels, scene, frame label and dimensions together. A source or clip that
changes while an outstanding seek is still preparing the frame produces a clear retry message.
After the pixels have been captured, encoding can complete independently of subsequent playback
or source changes. Clipboard fallback reuses the same capture, including when the clipboard fails
only after encoding; it no longer takes a new frame from the later video. An encoder returning no
PNG reports failure and leaves subsequent saves working.

Saved images have a content hash in their filename. Publishing uses a private staging file and
an atomic link that cannot overwrite an existing file. Identical retries return the existing path;
a different image gets a different path. A modified prior file or an occupied short-hash name is
preserved, with a complete-hash fallback. The save response includes the full SHA-256. Writes do
not follow symlinked workspace subdirectories or existing image names. The existing workspace
routes now reject foreign browser origins and non-loopback Host headers; the daemon's remote
viewer proxy already rewrites Host and Origin to the target origin, so its forwarding contract
is retained.

Verification:

- Before fixes, native Manim/Chrome reproduced all three failing assertions: wrong source/frame
  name, same path for different pixels, and replacement of the earlier image.
- All 50 Video Viewer tests now pass, covering native MP4 headers/library/server behavior plus
  version preservation, idempotent repeats, collision recovery, staging cleanup, symlink bounds,
  foreign origin/Host rejection, conflict responses and filesystem failures.
- Twelve native browser checks pass on the same original Manim renders: exact earlier PNG bytes
  despite a later render opening, distinct preserved versions, repeat identity, delayed clipboard
  denial, no recapture from the later video, null-encoder failure and recovery, and a 390px layout.
  There were no browser exceptions. The narrow pane and its Copy path action were visually checked.
- The fixture uses the existing Manim render wrapper and installed native engine, isolated under
  the evidence directory. No installed harness, user project, model provider or remote service was
  modified or called.

Evidence: `video-stills-before.txt`, `video-stills-before/`, `video-stills-tests-final.txt`,
`video-stills-final.txt`, and `video-stills-final/` under the local evidence root. The reproducible
native browser check and its original Manim source are included in the Video Viewer package.

## Thirteenth improvement: try a native starter from the checkout

Added `node store/tools/try-hands-on.mjs mujoco|strudel|circuitjs`. Each launch opens this branch's
viewer source on an editable, original starter: a pendulum, the Lantern room synth composition,
or the named-node RC circuit. The command prints a loopback URL, project directory and first action.
`--workspace` resumes a chosen folder without replacing its source; `--runtime-root` selects an
existing harness cache. The README and both field guides link to the short launcher instructions.

The launcher checks native assets and exact pinned Node dependency versions before creating the
project. It copies viewer code into an owned temporary runtime and links existing dependencies;
it does not install or update packages. Shutdown and startup cancellation stop the owned server
process group and remove only that runtime. Source and saved work remain in the project. The
instructions explain that default projects live under the system temporary directory and a durable
`--workspace` is preferable for ongoing work. A preview starts no agent chat.

Native startup exposed an existing MuJoCo bug: Node canonicalizes a linked entry's `import.meta.url`,
but the viewer compared it with an uncanonicalized process argument. The program silently exited
when launched through a linked package or macOS's `/var` alias. The main-module guard now compares
the real entry path, with an actual linked-package HTTP regression check. The original native
pendulum browser fixture is shared as an XML file rather than duplicated in the launcher.

Verification:

- All 31 MuJoCo package tests and the native WASM/server smoke checks pass, including a linked
  package entry serving its real viewer and model API with normal Node resolution and with
  `--preserve-symlinks-main`.
- Eleven native Chrome starter checks pass: a real MuJoCo gravity comparison and measured-frame
  jump, an exported experiment, audible Web Audio with a kept WAV/source/marker, actual CircuitJS
  samples, source editing and capture rendering after restart, and no browser exceptions.
- Those three journeys also pass with external requests blocked. Strudel's unchanged REPL attempts
  optional sample-index requests; its built-in synth composition continues to play and record.
  The checked native entry-asset hashes remain unchanged, and every owned preview runtime is removed.
- Seven process-lifecycle checks pass: linked CLI entry, invalid selection before mutation, an
  already-aborted launch, a reachable printed URL, Ctrl-C after readiness, retained edited source,
  and Ctrl-C during startup without a lingering runtime.
  The same seven checks also pass when Node preserves the CLI's symbolic link. A before-fix probe
  silently printed nothing even for `--help`; both the entry guard and repository lookup now use
  the real module path. MuJoCo likewise canonicalizes both sides of its entry comparison.
- The finished field guide passes all 63 browser checks again, including every actual local video,
  390/320px layouts, clipboard fallback, deep links, back navigation and JavaScript-disabled reading.
  The generated guide, 49-harness/10-viewer presentation and 59-entry catalog schema checks pass.
- All 431 existing Store/conformance tests pass on the final source, covering all 82 package
  manifests, declared instructions and skills, registry membership, licenses and Store facts.

The native starter screenshots were visually inspected. Evidence: `playgrounds-browser.txt`,
its printed `playgrounds-*/` directory, `playground-cli.txt`, its printed `playground-cli-*/` directory,
`mujoco-linked-tests.txt`, `hands-on-browser-final.txt`, `final-store-conformance.txt`, and `hands-on/`
under the local evidence root. The preserved-link CLI results are in
`playground-cli-preserved-links.txt` and its printed evidence directory.

## Delivery follow-up: recorded examples on the harness detail pages

The eight upgraded harnesses now lead their Store detail pages with the project shown in the
recording, its complete screenshot and a **Watch real session** action. **Try this prompt** retains
the exact example text. Existing examples remain available. Jev Sheets explicitly identifies its
fictional support tickets and offline practice answers. Recorded prompts and captions are kept in
`store/hands-on.json`; `node store/tools/hands-on.mjs --sync-store` updates the first Store example,
and `--check` verifies the metadata and committed media together.

An optional bounded HTTPS `video` field passes through the publisher, CLI schema and desktop
catalog. The detail page loads pictures only until someone chooses to watch. The native player
fits the complete frame, uses local HTML with a restrictive content policy, offers a browser
fallback, and pauses and removes its media on every route close. Native testing caught an actual
cleanup error: WebView rejects an empty HTML string. Closing now replaces the source with a valid
empty document. The player follows the desktop type scale, and bundled harness taglines now match
the changed catalog descriptions.

Restored the interrupted session into a durable worktree and integrated `main` at `8fdebad8`.
Validation on macOS with Flutter 3.47.2 / Dart 3.13:

- CLI typecheck and the complete CLI suite pass: **3,935 tests**, with 63 opt-in tests skipped.
- The directly affected desktop suites pass **96 tests**: catalog parsing, detail-page actions,
  narrow layouts, bundled identity, Store pages and exact prompt handoff into New Harness.
- The native `store_recordings_native_test.dart` passes against the actual GitHub-hosted MP4s:
  all eight decode and advance time with native controls; close removes the media, reopening
  works, Escape cleans up, and a missing video gives the browser fallback. The Blender dialog
  was visually inspected in the native app. This verifies recorded-video playback, not a fresh
  live-model run of every harness.
- Flutter analysis has no errors or warnings; 13 informational lints are in unchanged files.
- The complete desktop suite was exercised. Its remaining known failure is the missing bundled
  cover for `autonomous/harness-monitor` in `store_discover_test.dart`. The listed-package set,
  cover mapping, source records and assertion are identical on `main`; independently comparing
  those inputs confirms the same missing cover before these changes. Copy assertions affected by
  the new taglines were updated and pass in the focused suite.
- The eight-experience generator check and 59-entry catalog validation pass.

Repeat native playback from a published commit with:

```sh
cd desktop
FLUTTER_TEST=1 flutter test -d macos --no-pub \
  --dart-define=STORE_DEMO_CHECKOUT=/absolute/path/to/openharness \
  --dart-define=STORE_DEMO_REF=main \
  integration_test/store_recordings_native_test.dart
```

Current logs and the per-recording native dimensions, duration and playback state are in
`.scratch/harness-detail-evidence/` in the resumed worktree. The native fixture uses no Harness
account or user state. Catalog metadata publishes after merge; embedded playback ships in the
next desktop release, while older clients retain the new screenshots and prompts.
